<a name="397e9075fbf4ade8785b847a1b62607f">07/22/2022</a>    XENONnT hasn&#39;t detected an excess of ricocheting electrons:

              &#34;Two years ago, the XENON collaboration announced the
              observation of an excess of electronic recoil events in the
              XENON1T experiment. The result triggered a lot of interest
              and many publications since this could be interpreted as a
              signal of new physics beyond known phenomena. ... Today the
              XENON collaboration has released the first results from its
              new and more sensitive experiment, XENONnT, with one-fifth of
              the electronic recoil background of its predecessor, XENON1T.
              The absence of an excess in the new data indicates that the
              origin of the XENON1T signal was trace amounts of tritium in
              the liquid xenon, one of the hypotheses considered at the
              time. In consequence, this leads now to very strong limits on
              new physics scenarios originally invoked to explain an
              excess.&#34;

              I&#39;m surprised that XFCE uses more resources than MATE.
              Perhaps I will have to switch my VMs to test this out.
