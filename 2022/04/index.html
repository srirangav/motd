04/29/2022    Software doesn't work in "O" mode:

              Suggested rules of thumb are:

              1024K for general-purpose file sharing/storage
                64K for KVM virtual machines using Qcow2 file-based
                      storage
                16K for MySQL InnoDB
                 8K for PostgreSQL

04/21/2022    LHC is back online today:

              <a href="https://www.science20.com/news_staff/after_3_years_of_maintenance_the_large_hadron_collider_is_getting_back_into_collision_shape-256027">https://www.science20.com/news_staff/after_3_years_of_maintenance_the_large_hadron_collider_is_getting_back_into_collision_shape-256027</a>

              Things to look forward to include "two new experiments,
              FASER and SND@LHC, designed to look for physics beyond the
              Standard Model; special proton-helium collisions to measure
              how often the antimatter counterparts of protons are produced
              in these collisions; and collisions involving oxygen ions
              that will improve physicists' knowledge of cosmic-ray
              physics and the quark-gluon plasma, a state of matter that
              existed shortly after the Big Bang."

04/20/2022    CMS' new measurement of the Top Quark's mass of "171.77
              [+/-]0.38 GeV, is consistent with [] previous measurements
              and the prediction from the Standard Model":

04/19/2022    Thoughts on the CDF's measurment of the W boson's mass by
              Tommaso Doringo, who worked on the CDF:

              As an aside, I still need to read Doringo's book "Anomaly!
              Collider Physics and the Quest for New Phenomena at Fermilab"

04/06/2022    Neutrinos may not be their own anti-particle:

              "CUORE has spent the last three years patiently waiting to
              see evidence of a distinctive nuclear decay process, only
              possible if neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same
              particle. CUORE's new data shows that this decay doesn't
              happen for trillions of trillions of years, if it happens at
              all."

04/06/2022    Modify font smoothing on Big Sur (11.x) and Monterey (12.x):

              $ defaults -currentHost write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int [0-3]

              where 0 disables smoothing, 1 enables light smoothing,
              2 enables moderate / medium smoothing, and 3 enables
              strong smoothing.

              This requires a restart to take effect.
