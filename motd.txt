07/15/2024    The Gallium Anomaly:

              https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-could-explain-the-gallium-anomaly-20240712/

              "Using a nuclear reactor at the McClellan Nuclear Research
              Center at the University of California, Davis,
              [researchers] irradiated 'very pure germanium material,'
              ...  producing germanium-71. They then analyzed the
              samples over 80 days to see how long it took the atoms to
              decay.

              They arrived at a half-life of 11.468 days, extremely
              close to the 1985 measurement, ruling the half-life out as
              the explanation for the gallium anomaly.

              ...

              Another proposed explanation was that physicists had
              miscalculated the probability of neutrinos from the source
              interacting with the gallium. But in September 2023,
              [other researchers] also ruled out this possibility.

              ...

              Th[is] leaves physicists in an uncomfortable position.
              Either there is still some error that no one has thought
              of, or, as [one researcher] put it, 'something unusual is
              going on with neutrinos.'"

              "By embedding a thorium atom within a highly transparent
              crystal and bombarding it with lasers, [a research] group
              has succeeded in getting the nucleus of the thorium atom
              to absorb and emit photons like electrons in an atom do."
