04/03/2024    Hexagons are the bestagons (at least for self-assembly):

              https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s36

              "Florian Gartner and Erwin Frey from Ludwig Maximilian
              University of Munich simulated self-assembly of
              two-dimensional structures with three types of building
              blocks: triangles, squares, and hexagons. ... [They] found
              that certain shapes were better than others at assembling
              into larger structures, as they tended to form
              intermediate structures with more bonds around each block.
              In particular, hexagonal blocks were the most efficient
              building material, forming 1000-piece structures at a rate
              that was 10,000 times faster than triangular blocks.

              The results are not limited to geometrically simple
              shapes. 'Our insights hold relevance beyond these
              simplified models, extending to a wide range of biological
              and nanotechnological self-assembly processes,' Frey says."
