              Beethoven - The Universal Composer by Edmund Morris
              https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780060759759/beethoven/

              Wonderful compact biography of Beethoven.  It ought
              to come with a list of recommended recordings for
              each piece.

              Feynman by Jim Ottaviani (illustrated by Leland Myrick)
              https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781596438279/feynman

              Basically the graphic novel version of Surely You Are
              Joking Mr. Feynman and What Do You Care What Other
              People Think.  Excellent.
