12/11/2023    Ancient stars may have made extremely heavy elements:

              https://phys.org/news/2023-12-ancient-stars-extraordinarily-heavy-elements.html

              "The team took a fresh look at the amounts of heavy
              elements in 42 well-studied stars in the Milky Way. ...
              By taking a broader view of the amounts of each heavy
              element found in these stars collectively, rather than
              individually as is more common, they identified previously
              unrecognized patterns.

              ...

              Those patterns signaled that some elements listed near the
              middle of the periodic table - such as silver and
              rhodium - were likely the remnants of heavy element
              fission. The team was able to determine that the r-process
              can produce atoms with an atomic mass of at least 260
              before they fission."

12/08/2023    Wasabi may improve long and short term memory:

              https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wasabi-memory-boost-japanese-study-finds/

              "[In a] double-blind, randomized study involved 72 healthy
              subjects, aged 60 to 80. Half of them took 100 milligrams
              of wasabi extract at bedtime, with the rest receiving a
              placebo.

              After three months, the treated group registered
              'significant' boosts in two aspects of cognition, working
              (short-term) memory, and the longer-lasting episodic
              memory, based on standardized assessments for language
              skills, concentration and ability to carry out simple
              tasks.

              ....

              Subjects who received the wasabi treatment saw their
              episodic memory scores jump an average of 18%, Nouchi
              [the researcher] said, and scored on average 14% higher
              than the placebo group overall."
