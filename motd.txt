              "If you're on a call with a bunch of people and you want to
              reduce your data usage, here's a simple trick: put Zoom
              into a mini floating thumbnail window. ... Of course, it has
              a big disadvantage: you can only see one person in a tiny
              box!"

11/05/2024    A 27-Month Check-In on the Copyright Claims Board:

              https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2024/10/a-27-month-check-in-on-the-copyright-claims-board-ccb-guest-blog-post.htm

              "Of the 989 claims filed, there are only 819 total
              dispositions, meaning 170 claims are still pending. ... Of
              the 819 total dispositions, 391 (48%) were dismissed during
              claims review, 153 (19%) were not served, 82 (10%) were
              withdrawn, and 91 (11%) had defendants opt out.  That means
              717 claims (88%) were disposed of on procedural grounds,
              without a ruling on the merits. ... In total, the claimant
              received a settlement, a default judgment, or a final
              judgment in their favor in only about 100 cases, or 12
              percent of the 819 dispositions (excluding the cases that
              are still pending)."

11/04/2024    Paper types ranked by likelihood of paper cuts:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-08-paper-likelihood.html

              "The research team found that paper that was the most thin
              was unlikely to cause a cut because it tended to buckle
              instead. Also, thick paper rarely led to a cut because its
              surface was spread over too large an area. That left paper
              that is neither too thick nor too thin, like the kind that
              is used in newspapers or dot-matrix printers - the two types
              tied for the title 'Most likely to cut skin.'

              Other culprits were Post-It notes, printed magazines and
              office paper.  Some that were less likely to cut include
              tissue and photo paper. They noted that to cause cuts, the
              paper had to be angled slightly."
