04/20/2022    CMS' new measurement of the Top Quark's mass of "171.77
              [+/-]0.38 GeV, is consistent with [] previous measurements
              and the prediction from the Standard Model":

04/19/2022    Thoughts on the CDF's measurment of the W boson's mass by
              Tommaso Doringo, who worked on the CDF:

              As an aside, I still need to read Doringo's book "Anomaly!
              Collider Physics and the Quest for New Phenomena at Fermilab"

04/08/2022    W boson's mass may deviate from the Standard Model's
              prediction:

04/06/2022    Neutrinos may not be their own anti-particle:

              "CUORE has spent the last three years patiently waiting to
              see evidence of a distinctive nuclear decay process, only
              possible if neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same
              particle. CUORE's new data shows that this decay doesn't
              happen for trillions of trillions of years, if it happens at
              all."

04/06/2022    Modify font smoothing on Big Sur (11.x) and Monterey (12.x):

              $ defaults -currentHost write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int [0-3]

              where 0 disables smoothing, 1 enables light smoothing,
              2 enables moderate / medium smoothing, and 3 enables
              strong smoothing.

              This requires a restart to take effect.
