06/03/2024    GRB's may not be the primary source of heavy elements:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-05-universe-biggest-explosions-elements-mystery.html

              "Rapid neutron-capture process, or r-process, is where the
              nuclei (or cores) of heavier elements such as iron capture
              many neutron particles in a short time. They [] rapidly
              grow in mass, yielding much heavier elements. For
              r-process to work, however, you need the right conditions:
              high density, high temperature, and a large number of
              available free neutrons. Gamma ray bursts happen to
              provide these necessary conditions.

              ...

              A recent study investigated one long gamma ray burst in
              particular, GRB 221009. This has been dubbed the BOAT -
              the brightest of all time. ... The JWST team [] inferred
              the number of heavy elements produced during the BOAT
              explosion. They found no indication of elements produced
              by the r-process. ... These findings suggest that gamma
              ray bursts may not be the hoped-for crucial source of the
              universe's heavy elements. Instead, there must be a source
              or sources still out there."
