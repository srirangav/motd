11/21/2024    Scission neutrons:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-10-tracking-nuclear-fission-elusive-scission.html

              "[A] team led by Aurel Bulgac, a physics professor at UW,
              has conducted the first fully microscopic, quantum many-body
              simulation of a nucleus's neck rupture to produce the most
              accurate description yet of its fission dynamics. The team's
              surprising results reveal a scission mechanism that is at
              odds with some previous assumptions.

              ...

              The team's simulation found that the scission neutrons are
              emitted in two different, distinct modes. At the moment of
              scission, neutrons are emitted sideways. As the nucleus's
              two fragments move horizontally, neutrons are emitted in the
              plane perpendicular to the horizontal axis. At the same
              time, when the neck snaps, it sends a wave of matter to the
              nucleus that emerges on the other side. This forms two more
              clouds coming from the 'noses' of the fission fragments."

              "Increasing the carbon content of SiC improves its
              mechanical properties, according to computer simulations
              using Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel
              Simulator (LAMMPS) software. However, these improvements
              peak at a carbon percentage of 25%; beyond this, the
              material actually starts to weaken."

              https://phys.org/news/2024-10-banana-resistant-tr4-black-sigatoka.html

              "Researchers have developed a banana plant [named Yelloway
              One] that is resistant to both fusarium tropical race 4
              (TR4) and black sigatoka, two of the most destructive
              diseases for bananas.

              ...

              Yelloway One is still a prototype and is currently being
              grown in a greenhouse in the Netherlands. The plants will
              soon be sent to regions in the Philippines and Indonesia,
              where TR4 and black sigatoka have caused significant damage.
              Field trials will determine how well Yelloway One performs
              in a natural environment."

              "Of the 989 claims filed, there are only 819 total
              dispositions, meaning 170 claims are still pending. ... Of
              the 819 total dispositions, 391 (48%) were dismissed during
              claims review, 153 (19%) were not served, 82 (10%) were
              withdrawn, and 91 (11%) had defendants opt out.  That means
              717 claims (88%) were disposed of on procedural grounds,
              without a ruling on the merits. ... In total, the claimant
              received a settlement, a default judgment, or a final
              judgment in their favor in only about 100 cases, or 12
              percent of the 819 dispositions (excluding the cases that

11/04/2024    Paper types ranked by likelihood of paper cuts:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-08-paper-likelihood.html

              "The research team found that paper that was the most thin
              was unlikely to cause a cut because it tended to buckle
              instead. Also, thick paper rarely led to a cut because its
              surface was spread over too large an area. That left paper
              that is neither too thick nor too thin, like the kind that
              is used in newspapers or dot-matrix printers - the two types
              tied for the title 'Most likely to cut skin.'

              Other culprits were Post-It notes, printed magazines and
              office paper.  Some that were less likely to cut include
              tissue and photo paper. They noted that to cause cuts, the
              paper had to be angled slightly."
