12/11/2024    The vis-viva equation:

              "The vis-viva equation says that for an object orbiting another
              object in a Keplerian orbit[:]

              v^2 = u((2/r) - (1/a))

              Here v is the relative velocity of the two bodies, r is the
              distance between their centers of mass, and a is the semi-major
              axis of the orbit. The constant u is the standard gravitational
              parameter. It equals the product of the gravitational constant G
              and the combined mass M of the two bodies. In practice it is
              often accurate enough to let M be the mass of the larger object[.]

              ...

              For an object to escape the orbit of another, the ellipse of its
              orbit has to become infinitely large, i.e. a -> [infinity]. This
              says that if v is escape velocity, v^2 = 2u/r. For a rocket on
              the surface of a planet, r is the radius of the planet. But for
              an object already in a high orbit, escape velocity is less
              because r is larger."

              have gotten faster. Cars have always been faster. Cars have
              gotten smarter. There are cars with better MPG, and there are
              cars that are undoubtably a better bang for your buck in today's
              market. But there's no car that is as good as this."

12/11/2024    Why matter is solid:

              https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/quantum-reason-solidity-matter/

              "[W]hat happens when you bring two systems, or two objects, that
              are each made of atoms into contact with one another? Sure,
              there's still quantum uncertainty and there's still electrostatic
              repulsion, but now there's a third critical factor at play: the
              Pauli exclusion rule that applies to electrons. When you push
              your thumb down onto the seat of your chair, the electrons in
              your thumb are already occupying all the lowest-energy states
              that are available to them. Similarly, the electrons in the chair
              are already occupying all the lowest-energy states available to
              them.

              This means that the act of 'pushing' your thumb into the chair is
              equivalent to trying to push those occupied electrons into the
              same quantum state as one another: to have their energy levels
              overlap. But those levels are full; you can't fit anymore
              electrons in there! The chair's electrons would have to be bumped
              up to greater energies in order to move into (or through) your
              thumb, and your thumb's electrons would have to be bumped up to
              greater energies in order to move into (or through) your chair.
              No matter how strong you are, you simply don't have enough
              strength in your body to overcome the Pauli Exclusion Principle
              in this fashion."

12/11/2024    The CAFC provides additional guidance on inherency:

              "The question we must resolve ... is whether a claim limitation
              that merely recites an inherent property of an otherwise obvious
              combination requires additional analysis to demonstrate that a
              person of ordinary skill in the art would have a reasonable
              expectation of success. We conclude that this additional showing
              is not required."

              University in South Korea, has arrived at an answer [to the 'sofa
              problem'].  ... Baek found that for a hallway with a width of 1
              unit, the imaginary sofa's maximum area can be 2.2195 units -
              narrowing the answer down with precision from the previously
              known range of between 2.2195 and 2.37 units."

12/02/2024    Gravitational waves and black holes:

              https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/gravitational-wave-meet-black-hole/

              "[Gravitational waves] propagate in the same fashion that
              any massless quanta would travel, following the path laid
              out by the curved space that they propagate through.

              If that path takes you close to the event horizon of a black
              hole, you'll experience all the 'normal' relativistic
              phenomena (redshift/blueshift, time dilation/length
              contraction, frame-dragging, etc.), but you'll still be able
              to escape so long as you don't cross the event horizon.

              If you do cross it, however, there's only one option: you
              fall inexorably toward the central singularity, and upon
              crossing over the threshold of the event horizon, your
              energy and your angular momentum - both of which
              gravitational waves should possess with respect to the black
              hole - get added to the black hole itself. In other words,
              black holes do grow from devouring all they encounter, and
              gravitational waves help that to occur."

              "It is the world's rarest whale, with only seven of its kind
              ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic
              species.  ... None has ever been seen alive at sea. The list
              of what scientists don't know about spade-toothed whales is
              longer than what they do know. They don't know where in the
              ocean the whales live, why they've never been spotted in the
              wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have
              different stomach systems and researchers don't know how the
              spade-toothed kind processes its food."
