              1. "[T]urning off the hob midway and allowing the pasta
                 to cook in the residual heat will halve the cooking
                 cost"

              2. "[H]alving the water [used] resulted in perfect pasta"

              3. "[T]here is no need to bring the pan to a 'rolling boil'
                 at 100 C ... [g]entle simmering is sufficient to cook
                 the pasta completely"

                 can do."

              Beethoven - The Universal Composer by Edmund Morris
              https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780060759759/beethoven/

              Wonderful compact biography of Beethoven.  It ought
              to come with a list of recommended recordings for
              each piece.

              Feynman by Jim Ottaviani (illustrated by Leland Myrick)
              https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781596438279/feynman

              Basically the graphic novel version of Surely You Are
              Joking Mr. Feynman and What Do You Care What Other
              People Think.  Excellent.
