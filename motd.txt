08/09/2023    When did Postgres become cool?

              https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/when-did-postgres-become-cool

              Having used Postgres (and many other DBs), I'd
              say Postgres was always cool.

08/07/2023    Absent corrosion, Li occurs as a rhombic dodecahedron:

              https://phys.org/news/2023-08-true-lithium-revealed.html

              "Metallic lithium reacts so easily with chemicals that,
              under normal conditions, corrosion forms almost
              immediately while the metal is being laid down on a
              surface such as an electrode. But [] UCLA investigators
              developed a technique that prevents that corrosion and
              showed that, in its absence, lithium atoms assemble into a
              surprising shape - the rhombic dodecahedron, a 12-sided
              figure similar to the dice used in role-playing games"
