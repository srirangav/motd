07/23/2023    Slice onions pole to pole to reduce eye watering:

              https://laughingsquid.com/how-to-cut-onion/

              "The key sulfur product in the onion is called the
              lacrimator and this is released when we cut them.
              It is also the chemical responsible for making our eyes
              water ... onion cells are not symmetrical they're
              actually longer in pole-to-pole than orbital, meaning
              that orbital cuts rupture more onion cells releasing
              more lacrimators, meaning more eye watering[.]"

07/22/2023    "Dark Oxygen":

              https://www.quantamagazine.org/underground-cells-make-dark-oxygen-without-light-20230717/

              "[A] type of methane-feeding bacteria often found in lake
              sediments and wastewater sludges ha[ve] a strange way of
              life. Instead of taking in oxygen from its surroundings
              like other aerobes, the bacteria create[ their] own oxygen
              by using enzymes to break down the soluble compounds called
              nitrites (which contain a chemical group made of nitrogen
              and two oxygen atoms). The bacteria use[] the self-generated
              oxygen to split methane for energy. ... When microbes break
              down compounds this way, itâ€™s called dismutation. Until now,
              it was thought to be rare in nature as a method for
              generating oxygen. Recent laboratory experiments involving
              artificial microbe communities, however, revealed that the
              oxygen produced by dismutation can leak out of the cells and
              into the surrounding medium to the benefit of other oxygen-
              dependent organisms, in a kind of symbiotic process."

              The Ray Bradbury quote "It sounds like an animal,
              don't it" matches my memory of the San Francisco
              bay fog horn - it sounds like the worlds largest
              goose.

07/13/2023    The rings and bar of NGC 1398:

              https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230712.html

              "Spiral galaxy NGC 1398 not only has a ring of pearly
              stars, gas and dust around its center, but a bar of stars
              and gas across its center, and spiral arms that appear
              like ribbons farther out. ... The ring near the center is
              likely an expanding density wave of star formation, caused
              either by a gravitational encounter with another galaxy,
              or by the galaxy's own gravitational asymmetries."

              https://www.sci.news/astronomy/cheops-metal-clouds-atmosphere-ultrahot-neptune-12078.html

              "[E]xoplanet LTT 9779b reflects 80% of the light shone on
              it by its host star, LTT 9779, making it the shiniest
              exoplanet ever found. The reason for its high reflectivity
              is that it is covered by reflective clouds of metal and
              silicate."
