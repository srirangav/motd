              "On its first asteroid flyby on Nov. 1, NASA's Lucy
              mission discovered that the main belt asteroid Dinkinesh
              has a small moon orbiting it. Now, additional images have
              revealed another surprise: Dinkinesh's moon is not one,
              but two small satellites. The twin moons initially
              appeared as one because they are so close together, they
              touch as they orbit."

11/05/2023    Starfish are mostly head:

              https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/02/world/starfish-head-body-plan-scn/index.html

              "[N]ew genetic research suggests ... that sea stars are
              largely heads that lack torsos or tails and likely lost
              those features evolutionarily over time.  The researchers
              said the bizarre fossils of sea star ancestors, which
              appeared to have a kind of torso, make a lot more sense in
              evolutionary terms in light of the new findings.

              ...

               'When we compared the expression of genes in a starfish
               to other groups of animals, like vertebrates, it appeared
               that a crucial part of the body plan was missing,' [one
               of the researchers] said. 'The genes that are typically
               involved in the patterning of the trunk of the animal
               weren't expressed in the ectoderm. It seems the whole
               echinoderm body plan is roughly equivalent to the head in
               other groups of animals.'"

11/02/2023    N-9?

              https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/186
              https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-elusive-isotope-nitrogen-9

              "With seven protons and two neutrons, the lopsided atomic
              nucleus of nitrogen-9 pushes the limits of what can even
              be considered a nucleus at all.

              ...

              Protons and neutrons, the subatomic particles that make up
              atomic nuclei, are essentially glued together by the
              strong nuclear force ...[, b]ut the force can't
              hold together nuclei that have wildly skewed ratios of
              protons to neutrons. Too many of either particle -
              especially protons, which repel each other due to their
              positive charge - and the nuclear bucket starts to
              overflow.

              Beyond this overflow point, which physicists call the
              'drip line,' nuclei cannot fully bind their particles.

              ...

              Finding a nucleus as far beyond the drip line as
              nitrogen-9 - five protons beyond - was surprising ...
              [because, u]ntil now, scientists had only ever found
              isotopes up to four protons beyond the drip line."
