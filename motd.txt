05/25/2024    Cu coated stainless steel may kill bacteria:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-05-stainless-steel-bacteria-antibiotics-chemicals.html

              "An electrochemical process developed at Georgia Tech
              could offer new protection against bacterial infections
              without contributing to growing antibiotic resistance.

              The approach capitalizes on the natural antibacterial
              properties of copper and creates incredibly small
              needle-like structures on the surface of stainless steel
              to kill harmful bacteria like E. coli and Staphylococcus.
              It's convenient and inexpensive, and it could reduce the
              need for chemicals and antibiotics[.]"

              "Scientists have discovered a long-buried branch of the
              Nile river that once flowed alongside more than 30
              pyramids in Egypt[.] ... The 64-kilometer-long river
              branch, which ran by the iconic Giza pyramid complex among
              other wonders, was hidden under desert and farmland for
              millennia, according to a study[.]"

05/19/2024    Tauonium:

              https://www.sci.news/physics/true-tauonium-12936.html

              "Tauonium, composed of a tauon and its antiparticle, has a
              Bohr radius of only 30.4 femtometers - approximately
              1/1741 of the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom"
