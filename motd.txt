              Might need several of these - we keep misplacing our
              Apple TV remotes all the time.

01/22/2024    A PRNG that you can do in your head:

              https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/randomness/

              1. Choose a 2-digit number, say 23, your "seed".

              2. Form a new 2-digit number: the 10's digit plus 6 times
                 the units digit.

                 The example sequence is 23 -> 20 -> 02 -> 12 -> 13 ->
                                         19 -> 55 -> 35 -> ...

              3. The 'random digits' are the units digits of the 2-digit
                 numbers, ie, 3,0,2,2,3,9,5,...

01/19/2024    How the Manhattan project was funded:

              "Where exactly in the budget had the [FDR] administration
              hidden the money for the bomb?

              Finding a bill that passed eight decades ago is harder
              than you might think, but after a number of creative
              searches, I pulled up a record of a Senate hearing
              examining the bill. Attached was a report breaking down
              the legislation.

              I paged through, stopped and smiled when I saw it. There
              it was, the innocuous phrase that hid an $800 million
              secret: 'expediting production.'"

01/18/2024    What Happened to the US Machine Tool Industry?

01/17/2024    A dwarf galaxy with no visible stars:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-01-primordial-dark-galaxy-stars.html

              "J0613+52 is an odd [galaxy] when you compare it to the more
              familiar types such as the star-filled spirals and
              ellipticals. For one thing, it's a dwarf galaxy with an
              irregular shape. Without any obvious stars, it's quite
              dim. The most unusual thing about objects like this one is
              that dark matter appears to dominate their compositions.
              If J0613+52 is like others, it could have up to 95% dark
              matter constraining the neutral gaseous hydrogen that we
              can detect. ... In addition, J0613+52 lies too far from
              any neighboring galaxies to interact with them
              gravitationally. That means they can't trigger star
              formation through any possible mergers or collisions."

01/17/2024    Early galaxies appear to have been mostly long and thin:

01/17/2024    Cepheid variables probably not responsible for the Hubble tension:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-01-astronomers-explanation-hubble-tension.html

              "In this new study, the team looked at more than a
              thousand Cepheid variables and was able to pinpoint the
              distance relation for Cepheids with extreme precision.
              From this, they proved that Cepheid variable error can't
              account for the Hubble tension."

01/13/2024    The 18% O2 solution:

              https://bigthink.com/13-8/oxygen-bottleneck/

              "Drawing on experiments carried out across disciplines as
              varied as combustion engineering to biogeochemistry, we
              found that an atmosphere with anything less than 18%
              oxygen would not allow open-air combustion. Remarkably,
              for most of our planet's 4.5-billion-year history, Earth's
              oxygen levels have been way, way below 18%.  In fact, only
              over the past 500 million years or so has the atmosphere
              held enough oxygen for anything to freely burn in the open
              air.

              Why does any of this matter? Imagine a young and
              intelligent species on an alien world with an atmosphere
              that's just 1% oxygen. Those clever tool-using creatures
              would never get the chance to watch a tree burn after
              being hit by lightning and get the idea of using fire for
              their own purposes. They would never have the chance to
              learn how fire could be used to cook food, clear land, or,
              most importantly, melt metals. The poverty of oxygen in
              their air would likely box these creatures in forever,
              limiting their development."
