12/02/2024    Gravitational waves and black holes:

              https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/gravitational-wave-meet-black-hole/

              "[Gravitational waves] propagate in the same fashion that
              any massless quanta would travel, following the path laid
              out by the curved space that they propagate through.

              If that path takes you close to the event horizon of a black
              hole, you'll experience all the 'normal' relativistic
              phenomena (redshift/blueshift, time dilation/length
              contraction, frame-dragging, etc.), but you'll still be able
              to escape so long as you don't cross the event horizon.

              If you do cross it, however, there's only one option: you
              fall inexorably toward the central singularity, and upon
              crossing over the threshold of the event horizon, your
              energy and your angular momentum - both of which
              gravitational waves should possess with respect to the black
              hole - get added to the black hole itself. In other words,
              black holes do grow from devouring all they encounter, and
              gravitational waves help that to occur."

12/02/2024    Spade-toothed whales:

              https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spade-toothed_whale
              https://www.courthousenews.com/this-whale-species-is-so-rare-its-never-been-seen-alive-a-dissection-may-decode-its-mysteries/

              "It is the world's rarest whale, with only seven of its kind
              ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic
              species.  ... None has ever been seen alive at sea. The list
              of what scientists don't know about spade-toothed whales is
              longer than what they do know. They don't know where in the
              ocean the whales live, why they've never been spotted in the
              wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have
              different stomach systems and researchers don't know how the
              spade-toothed kind processes its food."
