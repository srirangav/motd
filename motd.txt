07/13/2023    The rings and bar of NGC 1398:

              https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap230712.html

              "Spiral galaxy NGC 1398 not only has a ring of pearly
              stars, gas and dust around its center, but a bar of stars
              and gas across its center, and spiral arms that appear
              like ribbons farther out. ... The ring near the center is
              likely an expanding density wave of star formation, caused
              either by a gravitational encounter with another galaxy,
              or by the galaxy's own gravitational asymmetries."

              https://www.sci.news/astronomy/cheops-metal-clouds-atmosphere-ultrahot-neptune-12078.html

              "[E]xoplanet LTT 9779b reflects 80% of the light shone on
              it by its host star, LTT 9779, making it the shiniest
              exoplanet ever found. The reason for its high reflectivity
              is that it is covered by reflective clouds of metal and
              silicate."
