09/21/2023    Surface Laptop Go 3:

              https://www.inverse.com/tech/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-3-hands-on

              Reminds me of the 12in Retina MacBook, which
              is one of my favorite MacBooks of all time
              (along with the PB 180, the Pismo, the TiBook,
              and the M1 Air).

09/18/2023    A remake of the Murder on the Orient Express game is coming soon:

              https://www.agathachristie.com/games/murder-on-the-orient-express

              I'll probably give it a try, but, based on the
              screenshots, I think they probably aren't going
              to have David Suchet voice Poirot, so my guess
              is that I'll end up preferring the 2006 version
              (which, like the other two Agatha Christie games
              by The Adventure Company - And Then There Were
              None, and Evil Under the Sun - runs fine on MacOS
              under CrossOvers).

09/12/2023    Which BSD did you start on?

              https://rubenerd.com/which-bsd-did-you-start-on/

              My first full BSD was SunOS 4.1.1 on a SS2. In
              terms of BSD userland, it is a toss-up between
              MachTen or Domain/OS.

              As an aside, the SS2 is one of my favorite Sparcs.
              The others I fondly remember are the SS10 and the
              Ultra 1.

09/12/2023    Eisenhower, Vinson, and Warren:

              https://stevevladeck.substack.com/p/44-eisenhower-vinson-and-warren

              "There's quite a lot of debate ... on what would
              have happened if Vinson hadn't died) about
              whether Vinson, a native Kentuckian (and Southern
              Democrat) would have voted to desegregate public
              schools. ...  We'll never know, of course. But
              part of the story is not just Vinson's untimely
              demise; it's who replaced him. On October 2,
              [1953,] President Eisenhower, making his first
              appointment to the Court since taking office in
              January, named California Governor Earl Warren as
              the Court's 14th Chief Justice."

              "[A beaver] kit sighting in Matadero Creek ...
              marks the first time in decades - if not more
              than a century - that a beaver colony has taken
              up residence in this region south of the San
              Francisco Bay."
