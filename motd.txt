              https://www.sci.news/medicine/antiviral-wood-13031.html

              "[R]esults ... with an enveloped coronavirus showed that
              pine, spruce, birch and alder need one hour to completely
              reduce the virus' ability to infect cells, with eucalyptus
              and oak needing two hours.

              Pine had the fastest onset of antiviral activity,
              beginning after five minutes. Spruce came in second,
              showing a sharp drop in infectivity after 10 minutes.

              For a nonenveloped enterovirus, [] researchers found that
              incubation on oak and spruce surfaces resulted in a loss
              of infectivity within about an hour, with oak having an
              onset time of 7.5 minutes and spruce after 60 minutes.

              Pine, birch and eucalyptus reduced the virus' infectivity
              after four hours, and alder showed no antiviral effect."

06/03/2024    GRB's may not be the primary source of heavy elements:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-05-universe-biggest-explosions-elements-mystery.html

              "Rapid neutron-capture process, or r-process, is where the
              nuclei (or cores) of heavier elements such as iron capture
              many neutron particles in a short time. They [] rapidly
              grow in mass, yielding much heavier elements. For
              r-process to work, however, you need the right conditions:
              high density, high temperature, and a large number of
              available free neutrons. Gamma ray bursts happen to
              provide these necessary conditions.

              ...

              A recent study investigated one long gamma ray burst in
              particular, GRB 221009. This has been dubbed the BOAT -
              the brightest of all time. ... The JWST team [] inferred
              the number of heavy elements produced during the BOAT
              explosion. They found no indication of elements produced
              by the r-process. ... These findings suggest that gamma
              ray bursts may not be the hoped-for crucial source of the
              universe's heavy elements. Instead, there must be a source
              or sources still out there."
