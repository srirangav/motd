09/12/2024    Bose glass:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-09-discovery-phase-2d-defies-statistical.html

              "Physicists from the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge have
              created the first two-dimensional version of the Bose glass,
              a novel phase of matter that ... has some glassy properties
              and within it all particles are localized. This means that
              each particle in the system sticks to itself, not mixing
              with its neighbors.

              ...

              To create this new phase of matter, the group overlapped
              several laser beams to create a quasiperiodic pattern, a
              pattern that is long-range ordered like a conventional
              crystal, but not periodic, meaning that, like a Penrose
              tiling, it never repeats. When filling the resulting
              structure with ultracold atoms, cooled to nanokelvin
              temperatures ... close to absolute zero, the atoms formed
              the Bose glass."

              The Sculpt has been my favorite keyboard for years.  I've
              used it without problems on MacOS, Debian, and OpenBSD.

09/01/2024    Picking up a Quicksilver G4:

              https://rubenerd.com/picking-up-a-powermac-g4-quicksilver/

              I had a 400MHz Graphite, a dual 1GHz Quicksilver and a dual
              2GHz G5.  Of these, the Quicksilver was my favorite because
              it was reasonably fast, easy to work on, and easy to carry.
              I've also thought about picking up one of these, but a 2005
              2.3GHz G5 probably would be more practical since it can run
              both OSX (10.4 and 10.5), OS9 (in Classic), and FreeBSD 13
              (with ZFS!).
