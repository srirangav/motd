02/13/2024    The appendix may not be useless:

              https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/02/02/1228474984/appendix-function-appendicitis-gut-health

              "It turns out that the appendix appears to have two
              related functions. The first function is supporting the
              immune system. The appendix has a high concentration of
              immune tissue, so it's acting to help the immune system
              fight any bad things in the gut.

              The second function that it serves is what we refer to as
              the safe house. ... During times of gastrointestinal
              distress - you know, a diarrhea episode where all of your
              good gut bacteria is getting kind of flushed out of the
              system - the appendix is kind of this blind tube with a
              very narrow diameter and narrow lumen, so the good
              bacteria doesn't get flushed out of the appendix. The idea
              is it's safe during this time of gastrointestinal distress
              and it can then exit the appendix and recolonize this good
              bacteria throughout the rest of the gut."

              https://www.logikalsolutions.com/wordpress/information-technology/never/

              I particularly agree with never omitting {} around a
              single statement condition, never putting { on the same
              line as code, never butting more than 130 characters on a
              line (though I normally still try to keep it below 75,
              except for URLs), and never putting local includes before
              global includes.
