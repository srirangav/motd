03/28/2022    The rise of Python in scientific computing:

              https://cerfacs.fr/coop/fortran-vs-python

              It has been decades since I've used Fortran or had to 
              do scientific programming, but even I was using Fortran
              it wasn't particularly likable or easy to use.  Python 
              and numpy, on the other hand, are fairly likable and 
              easy to use, while not being *that* slow, which makes
              it funto try out things that can be optimized later.

03/28/2022    Thoughts on retro-computing:

              https://kevinboone.me/retrocomputing.html?i=1

              I generally agree with this, with perhaps the exception 
              of the statement that "[o]ld computers are not, for the 
              most part, things of beauty, or even evocative of a lost 
              culture, like steam locomotives or duelling pistols."

              A NeXT Cube, an Indigo, an Indigo2, an Iris, an O2, a G4
              iMac (Lampshade), a SS2/SS10, G3 Pismo, TiBook (sans 
              delamination), and a G4 SawTooth/Mystic/Quicksilver, a 
              Qudra 700, a 20th Anniversary Mac, all of which are 
              probably considered "retro" now, could definitely be 
              considered "things of beauty" and are "evocative of a 
              lost culture" where users could easily work on their 
              computers.

03/27/2022    Interesting thoughts on Voyager (especially the observation
              that "the crew settled down *awfully* quickly"):

              https://danluu.com/voyager-story/

              I can't help but think that a crew that took longer to
              integrate would have made the first season more watchable.

              Along the same lines, it was probably a missed opportunity
              to explore a storyline where Seska finds out that she is
              Cardassian but wants to remain Bajoran (a reverse Kira, if
              you will).  Her relationship with the crew and Chakotay 
              might have been much more interesting, not to mention that
              we might have gotten stories like the Wire or Empok Nor.

               upstream Wine. We also included dozens of changes from 
               Wine 6.0.1 and 6.0.2 and updated to Wine Mono 7.0.

               Audio now works on both Mac and Linux for Halo: Master

               On macOS, we fixed a long-standing issue with mouse

03/21/2022    Recent gravity wave detector studies rule out certain 
              scalar field dark matter models and dark photon theories:

              "In December, a team led by Hartmut Grote of Cardiff 
               University reported in Nature that they had used a 
               gravitational wave detector to look for scalar-field 
               dark matter ... . The team didn’t find a signal, ruling 
               out a large class of scalar-field dark matter models. 
               Now the stuff [dark matter] can only exist if it affects 
               normal matter very weakly — at least a million times more 
               weakly than was previously thought possible.

               ...

               Meanwhile, [Keith] Riles [at the University of Michigan] 
               and his colleagues have been searching for signs of 'dark 
               photons' in data from LIGO ... and its partner [] Virgo[.]
               ... But the researchers found no such correlations in the 
               data. Their result, reported last year, means that dark 
               photons, if real, must be at least 100 times weaker than 
               previously allowed."

03/16/2022    CERN experiments with super-cooled Helium with an electron 
              replaced with an anti-proton:

              https://www.interactions.org/press-release/asacusa-sees-surprising-behaviour-hybrid-matter-antimatter

              "[The researchers] saw a decrease in the width of the 
               antiproton spectral lines. Moreover, when they decreased 
               the temperature of the liquid helium to values below the 
               temperature at which the liquid becomes a superfluid, i.e. 
               flows without any resistance, they found an abrupt further
               narrowing of the spectral lines.

               ...

               The researchers think that the surprising behaviour 
               observed is linked to the radius of the electronic orbital,
               i.e. the distance at which the hybrid helium atom’s electron
               is located. In contrast to that of many normal atoms, the
               radius of the hybrid atom’s electronic orbital changes very
               little when laser light is shone on the atom and thus does
               not affect the spectral lines even when the atom is immersed
               in superfluid helium."

03/15/2022    Pulsars may be the source of some of the positrons (anti-

03/15/2022    A new theory on ultra-light dark matter particles helping 
              matter to collapse into supermassive black holes during 
              the early days of the universe:

              http://www.sci-news.com/astronomy/early-universe-phase-transition-supermassive-black-holes-10621.html
              https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.081101

              According to the article, this theory makes a testable 
              prediction on a type of gravity wave that could be detected 
              by next generation gravity wave detectors.

03/10/2022    I discovered something new about macports today:

              $ sudo port reclaim

              which, according to port(1), "[r]eclaims disk space by 
              uninstalling inactive ports and removing unneeded 
              installation files."

              Not sure how I had missed this despite using macports
              for years.  From now on, I will have to remember to do
              the following when updating macports:

              $ sudo port selfupdate
              $ sudo port -u upgrade outdated
              $ sudo port reclaim
