08/19/2025    Photographing small birds - focus on the head:

              https://www.thephoblographer.com/2025/08/13/the-big-lie-about-bird-photography/

              "[F]ocus on the bird's head. This may mean the beak, the
              feathers, etc. The depth of field of the lenses that you're using
              is often enough to get the whole head in focus. That will
              obviously include the eyes too. ...  Focusing on a bigger object
              like the head will make keeping the bird in focus a whole lot
              easier. Focusing on the neck, depending on the type of bird,
              could also work[.]"

08/08/2025    Delta-Plutonium explained:

              https://phys.org/news/2025-08-plutonium-peculiar-behavior.html

              "Researchers from [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]
              demonstrate[d] a model that can reproduce and explain
              delta-plutonium's thermal behavior and unusual properties. The
              model calculates the material's free energy, a quantity that
              reflects the amount of available or useful energy in a system.

              ...

              Plutonium's electronic structure is among the most complex of all
              elemental metals because its electrons are easily influenced by
              relativity, magnetism and crystal structure. The new free-energy
              model accounts for magnetic fluctuation effects for the first
              time.  ...  Acknowledging those magnetic states in the theory
              causes it to match the odd experimental observations of
              contraction at high temperatures."
