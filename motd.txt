03/10/2022    I discovered something new about macports today:

              $ sudo port reclaim

              which, according to port(1), "[r]eclaims disk space by 
              uninstalling inactive ports and removing unneeded 
              installation files."

              Not sure how I had missed this despite using macports
              for years.  From now on, I will have to remember to do
              the following when updating macports:

              $ sudo port selfupdate
              $ sudo port -u upgrade outdated
              $ sudo port reclaim

              See: https://lists.macports.org/pipermail/macports-users/2022-March/050900.html

              In other macports news, macports 2.7.2 is now available:
