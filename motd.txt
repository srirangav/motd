              https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2022/11/19/how-to-depress-a-cubic/

              A depressed cubic equation is one in which "the
              the quadratic term has been removed", i.e. one
              without a x^2:

              x^3 + cx + d = 0

11/07/2022    Passive pasta cooking:

              https://www.barilla.com/en-gb/passive-cooking

              "Passive Cooking is a technique that has been
              around since the mid-19th century. It is an
              alternative method of cooking pasta that saves
              energy and reduces CO2 emissions ... To adopt
              it, simply turn off the stove after 2 minutes
              of active cooking, cover the pot with a lid
              and wait for the right cooking time."

              Need to try this out soon and see how it compares
              to regular pasta cooking.
