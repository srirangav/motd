01/19/2023    The amount of Cycloartenyl ferulate (CAF) found in brown
              rice contributes to its antioxidant properties according
              to new research from Japan:

              https://phys.org/news/2023-01-brown-rice-healthy-decoding-chemistry.html

              "[A] recent study led by Professor Yoshimasa Nakamura
              from the Graduate School of Environmental and Life
              Science, Okayama University ... identified cycloartenyl
              ferulate (CAF) as the main 'cytoprotective' or cell-
              protecting compound in brown rice. ... [The study found]
              evidence of CAF's antioxidant properties by demonstrating
              that it can protect cells from stress caused by hydrogen
              peroxide. Although hydrogen peroxide is a by-product of
              a cell's metabolic processes, abnormal amounts of the
              compound can be toxic to cells and cause irreversible
              damage. Treatment of cells with CAF increased their
              resistance to toxic stress induced by hydrogen peroxide."

              https://theconversation.com/italys-pasta-row-a-scientist-on-how-to-cook-spaghetti-properly-and-save-money-191973

              1. "[T]urning off the hob midway and allowing the pasta
                 to cook in the residual heat will halve the cooking
                 cost"

              2. "[H]alving the water [used] resulted in perfect pasta"

              3. "[T]here is no need to bring the pan to a 'rolling boil'
                 at 100 C ... [g]entle simmering is sufficient to cook
                 the pasta completely"

              4. "Keeping a lid on the pan is another simple thing you
                 can do."

              Beethoven - The Universal Composer by Edmund Morris
              https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780060759759/beethoven/

              Wonderful compact biography of Beethoven.  It ought
              to come with a list of recommended recordings for
              each piece.

              Feynman by Jim Ottaviani (illustrated by Leland Myrick)
              https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781596438279/feynman

              Basically the graphic novel version of Surely You Are
              Joking Mr. Feynman and What Do You Care What Other
              People Think.  Excellent.
