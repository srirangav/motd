03/26/2024    Why blueberries are blue:

              https://www.livescience.com/chemistry/why-are-blueberries-blue

              "While blueberries contain strong pigments called
              anthocyanins, these have a deep reddish-purple color,
              completely different from the indigo shade of the fruit
              skin. However, like most plants, blueberries are coated in
              a thin layer of protective wax which acts as a waterproof
              coating and barrier against infection. ...

              [Researchers] suspected the blue hue must come from
              outside of the fruit. So they removed a sample of this wax
              and recrystallized it on a piece of cardboard. To their
              delight, this created an ultra-thin crystalline coating
              with blueberry's trademark indigo color. When they looked
              closely at this layer, they found a random distribution of
              crystal structures within the wax which scatter blue and
              UV light to produce the fruit's signature color."
