07/23/2024    How many children did Lady Macbeth have?

              https://lifeandletters.substack.com/p/how-many-children-had-lady-macbeth

              "We know Lady Macbeth had a child at some point ... [a]nd we
              know that Macbeth is concerned about his 'fruitless crown,'
              the perennial problem of succession in the absence of an
              heir. 'Why does Lady Macbeth allude to a dead infant?' or
              'Why are the Macbeths childless?' are perfectly sensible
              questions to ask, and many literary scholars have written
              very good articles about them. It's the 'how many' that
              makes the question ridiculous, demanding a degree of
              precision the play will never provide."

              "[A]n international team of researchers led by Berkeley Lab's
              Heavy Element Group announced that they have made known
              superheavy element 116 using a titanium beam, a breakthrough
              that is a key stepping stone towards making element 120."

07/22/2024    Nuclear spin anomaly resolved:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-07-scientists-debated-anomaly-nuclei.html

              "[Previous] measurements found that for fast rotations, for
              example in nuclei like neon-20 or chromium-48, the energy
              for spinning changes unexpectedly.  Scientists attributed
              this to an anomalous increase in the moment of inertia
              for fast rotations, likely due to the nuclear matter
              bulging out. Earlier models suggested that fast-rotating
              nuclei ultimately become spheres, but newer models have
              found deformed shapes. Now, large-scale simulations of
              atomic nuclei have revealed surprising new explanations
              of the elusive physics of fast-spinning nuclei.

              ...

              [New s]imulations d[id] not find the anomalous increase.
              Instead, they reveal[ed] a change in the interior of the
              nucleus. ... [The simulations showed that] several
              competing shapes emerge, some prolate and some oblate, which
              on average appear spherical."

07/15/2024    The Gallium Anomaly:

              https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-could-explain-the-gallium-anomaly-20240712/

              "Using a nuclear reactor at the McClellan Nuclear Research
              Center at the University of California, Davis,
              [researchers] irradiated 'very pure germanium material,'
              ...  producing germanium-71. They then analyzed the
              samples over 80 days to see how long it took the atoms to
              decay.

              They arrived at a half-life of 11.468 days, extremely
              close to the 1985 measurement, ruling the half-life out as
              the explanation for the gallium anomaly.

              ...

              Another proposed explanation was that physicists had
              miscalculated the probability of neutrinos from the source
              interacting with the gallium. But in September 2023,
              [other researchers] also ruled out this possibility.

              ...

              Th[is] leaves physicists in an uncomfortable position.
              Either there is still some error that no one has thought
              of, or, as [one researcher] put it, 'something unusual is
              going on with neutrinos.'"

              crystal and bombarding it with lasers, [a research] group
              has succeeded in getting the nucleus of the thorium atom
              to absorb and emit photons like electrons in an atom do."
