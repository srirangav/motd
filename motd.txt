09/16/2024    The Ars Technica Sequoia review:

              Overall sounds like a worthwhile upgrade once 15.1 is out,
              especially Chess.app :-), FSKit, rotating random MAC
              addresses:

              But, running non-notarized software looks like it will be an
              annoying two step process instead of the existing
              right-click/control-click method:

              1. "[T]ry to launch the app and dismiss the dialog box telling
                 you that it can't be opened."

              2. "[O]pen Settings, go to the Privacy & Security screen,
                 scroll all the way to the bottom to get to the Security
                 section, and click the Open Anyway button that appears
                 for the last unsigned app you tried to run."


09/15/2024    Two Supermassive black holes heading for a merger:

              https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-022

              "The Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray
              Observatory looked in the heart of a pair of colliding
              galaxies and uncovered twin supermassive black holes
              waltzing around each other. ... They are approximately 300
              light-years apart - the closest AGN [Active Galactic
              Nucleus] pair seen in visible-light and X-ray wavelengths.

              ...

              The two supermassive black holes were once at the core of
              their respective host galaxies. A merger between the
              galaxies brought the black holes into close proximity. They
              will continue to spiral closer together until they
              eventually merge - in perhaps 100 million years - rattling
              the fabric of space and time as gravitational waves."

09/12/2024    Bose glass:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-09-discovery-phase-2d-defies-statistical.html

              "Physicists from the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge have
              created the first two-dimensional version of the Bose glass,
              a novel phase of matter that ... has some glassy properties
              and within it all particles are localized. This means that
              each particle in the system sticks to itself, not mixing
              with its neighbors.

              ...

              To create this new phase of matter, the group overlapped
              several laser beams to create a quasiperiodic pattern, a
              pattern that is long-range ordered like a conventional
              crystal, but not periodic, meaning that, like a Penrose
              tiling, it never repeats. When filling the resulting
              structure with ultracold atoms, cooled to nanokelvin
              temperatures ... close to absolute zero, the atoms formed
              the Bose glass."

              The Sculpt has been my favorite keyboard for years.  I've
              used it without problems on MacOS, Debian, and OpenBSD.

09/01/2024    Picking up a Quicksilver G4:

              https://rubenerd.com/picking-up-a-powermac-g4-quicksilver/

              I had a 400MHz Graphite, a dual 1GHz Quicksilver and a dual
              2GHz G5.  Of these, the Quicksilver was my favorite because
              it was reasonably fast, easy to work on, and easy to carry.
              I've also thought about picking up one of these, but a 2005
              2.3GHz G5 probably would be more practical since it can run
              both OSX (10.4 and 10.5), OS9 (in Classic), and FreeBSD 13
              (with ZFS!).
