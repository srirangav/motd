05/30/2024    A nucleus' effective charge depends on the number of neutrons:

              https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s65

              "The nuclear shell model assigns each nucleon to a
              single-particle state that is similar to an electron
              orbital in an atom. Researchers have previously shown that
              the effective charge is different for different nuclei,
              but it hasn't been clear whether the variation was
              attributable to differences in the orbital configuration
              of the nuclei or to differences in isospin (or both).

              ...

              [R]esearchers observed cadmium-130 nuclei produced when a
              uranium beam ... collided with a beryllium target. They
              combined shell model calculations and the new data along
              with previous data to determine an effective proton charge
              of +1.35 for this neutron-rich nucleus, compared with
              +1.17 for cadmium-98, suggesting an unexpectedly strong
              isospin dependence of the effective charge."

05/25/2024    Cu coated stainless steel may kill bacteria:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-05-stainless-steel-bacteria-antibiotics-chemicals.html

              "An electrochemical process developed at Georgia Tech
              could offer new protection against bacterial infections
              without contributing to growing antibiotic resistance.

              The approach capitalizes on the natural antibacterial
              properties of copper and creates incredibly small
              needle-like structures on the surface of stainless steel
              to kill harmful bacteria like E. coli and Staphylococcus.
              It's convenient and inexpensive, and it could reduce the
              need for chemicals and antibiotics[.]"

05/19/2024    The pyramids were built along long-lost branch of the Nile:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-05-pyramids-built-lost-river-scientists.html

              "Scientists have discovered a long-buried branch of the
              Nile river that once flowed alongside more than 30
              pyramids in Egypt[.] ... The 64-kilometer-long river
              branch, which ran by the iconic Giza pyramid complex among
              other wonders, was hidden under desert and farmland for
              millennia, according to a study[.]"

05/19/2024    Tauonium:

              https://www.sci.news/physics/true-tauonium-12936.html

              "Tauonium, composed of a tauon and its antiparticle, has a
              Bohr radius of only 30.4 femtometers - approximately
              1/1741 of the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom"
