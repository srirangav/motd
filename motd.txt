02/16/2025    The lost pyramid of Dahshur:

              https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/archaeologists-in-disbelief-after-breaking-into-a-4000-year-old-sealed-egyptian-pyramid/

              "Among the remnants of the burial [in the pyramid],
              archaeologists discovered a canopic chest inscribed with faded
              hieroglyphs. With advanced scanning technology, experts
              deciphered the markings, revealing the name of the tomb's
              occupant: Princess Hatshepsut.

              This was not the famous Pharaoh Hatshepsut of the 18th Dynasty
              but an entirely different royal figure. Until now, no records
              mentioned another Hatshepsut, making this discovery even more
              extraordinary. The presence of her own pyramid suggests she was a
              person of great significance, yet her name had been erased from
              history."

              "The neutrino that was detected had an energy of at least 60
              Peta-electronVolts, possibly hitting 230 PeV. ... Attempts to
              trace back the neutrino to a source make it clear that it
              originated outside our galaxy[.]"

02/12/2025    Interesting family of Pythagorean triples:

              https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/02/11/binary-triples/

              a = 2^(4n) + 2^(2n+1)
              b = 2^(4n) - 2^(4n-2) - 2^(2n) - 1
              c = 2^(4n) + 2^(4n-2) + 2^(2n) + 1

              https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/astronomers-discover-quipu-the-single-largest-structure-in-the-known-universe

              "Astronomers have discovered what may be the largest-scale
              structure in the known universe - a group of galaxy clusters and
              clusters of galaxy clusters that spans roughly 1.3 billion
              light-years across and contains a mind-boggling 200 quadrillion
              solar masses.

              The newfound structure is dubbed Quipu after an Incan system of
              counting and storing numbers using knots on cords.

              ... [T]he structure is complex, made up of one long filament and
              multiple side filaments[,] ...  potentially making it the largest
              object in the universe in terms of length, beating out previous
              record-holders such as the Laniakea supercluster."
