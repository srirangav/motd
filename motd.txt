              https://www.deusinmachina.net/p/coding-without-braces-an-alternate

              "C allows the use of digraphs (two letter combinations that
              represent a single letter) like <% and %> as alternatives of
              { and } and <: and :> as substitutes for [ and ]."

              See: https://www.gnu.org/software/c-intro-and-ref/manual/html_node/Digraphs.html

10/10/2024    Gurung v. MetaQuotes - forum selection clause in EULA enforced:

              https://tlblog.org/a-troubling-decision-in-the-edny/

              "The district court [] held ... that the phrase ['[a]ny legal
              action or proceeding arising under this Agreement'] conveyed
              an intent to cover non-contractual claims for three reasons.
              First, it explained that Second Circuit precedent favored an
              'expansive reading of the scope of forum selection clauses,
              in keeping with the policy favoring their use.' Second, it
              reasoned that Gurung's claims had 'grown out of' the
              contractual relationship and that the 'gist' of her
              non-contract claims involved a breach of the contract.
              Third, the court concluded that the Gurung's non-contract
              claims involved 'the same operative facts as a parallel
              claim for breach of contract.'

              The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that
              enforcing the clause would be unreasonable under the
              circumstances. Although the plaintiff claimed that she could
              not afford to litigate in Cyprus, the court held that this
              argument was foreclosed by Effron v. Sun Line Cruises, Inc.
              ..., a 1995 decision by the Second Circuit, that [] enforced
              a Greek forum selection clause against a woman who had
              brought a slip-and-fall case against a cruise line
              notwithstanding her claims that she could not afford to
              litigate in Greece."

10/09/2024    How to identify left vs. right trunked elephants:

              https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.240851

              "Elephants use the distal third of their trunk to wrap food
              or other objects and the whiskers are longer on the side
              they prefer wrapping towards, designating [] 'trunkedness'
              ... [-] [w]hisker abrasion appears on the opposite side of
              the one wrapped towards, as it is more often in contact with
              the ground."

10/04/2024    Is HTTPS always necessary?

              https://rubenerd.com/https-as-an-accessibility-issue/

              "This gets us back to the value proposition of HTTPS. ...
              [Is it] really necessary for a blog without a web-facing
              admin portal, software downloads, or mission-critical
              features? Have I shut people out for benefits that don't
              really make sense in this context? Have a lot of us?"
