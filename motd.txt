02/12/2025    The most energetic neutrino detected thus far:

              https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/most-energetic-neutrino-yet-seen-smashes-through-seafloor-detector/

              "The neutrino that was detected had an energy of at least 60
              Peta-electronVolts, possibly hitting 230 PeV. ... Attempts to
              trace back the neutrino to a source make it clear that it
              originated outside our galaxy[.]"

02/12/2025    Interesting family of Pythagorean triples:

              https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2025/02/11/binary-triples/

              a = 2^(4n) + 2^(2n+1)
              b = 2^(4n) - 2^(4n-2) - 2^(2n) - 1
              c = 2^(4n) + 2^(4n-2) + 2^(2n) + 1

02/09/2025    Quipu:

              https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/astronomers-discover-quipu-the-single-largest-structure-in-the-known-universe

              "Astronomers have discovered what may be the largest-scale
              structure in the known universe - a group of galaxy clusters and
              clusters of galaxy clusters that spans roughly 1.3 billion
              light-years across and contains a mind-boggling 200 quadrillion
              solar masses.

              The newfound structure is dubbed Quipu after an Incan system of
              counting and storing numbers using knots on cords.

              ... [T]he structure is complex, made up of one long filament and
              multiple side filaments[,] ...  potentially making it the largest
              object in the universe in terms of length, beating out previous
              record-holders such as the Laniakea supercluster."
