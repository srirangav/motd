03/16/2022    CERN experiments with super-cooled Helium with an electron 
              replaced with an anti-proton:

              https://www.interactions.org/press-release/asacusa-sees-surprising-behaviour-hybrid-matter-antimatter

              "[The researchers] saw a decrease in the width of the antiproton 
               spectral lines. Moreover, when they decreased the temperature of
               the liquid helium to values below the temperature at which the 
               liquid becomes a superfluid, i.e. flows without any resistance, 
               they found an abrupt further narrowing of the spectral lines.

               ...

               The researchers think that the surprising behaviour observed
               is linked to the radius of the electronic orbital, i.e. the
               distance at which the hybrid helium atom’s electron is
               located. In contrast to that of many normal atoms, the
               radius of the hybrid atom’s electronic orbital changes very
               little when laser light is shone on the atom and thus does
               not affect the spectral lines even when the atom is immersed
               in superfluid helium."

03/16/2022    QEMU 7.0 will have 9pfs for MacOSX hosts (yay!):

              Hopefully someday, sound for PPC and 3D acceleration for Windows
              will be merged in:

03/15/2022    Pulsars may be the source of some of the positrons (anti-
              matter) we detect here on earth:

03/15/2022    A new theory on ultra-light dark matter particles helping 
              matter to collapse into supermassive black holes during 
              the early days of the universe:

              https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.081101

              According to the article, this theory makes a testable 
              prediction on a type of gravity wave that could be detected 
              by next generation gravity wave detectors.

03/10/2022    I discovered something new about macports today:

              $ sudo port reclaim

              which, according to port(1), "[r]eclaims disk space by 
              uninstalling inactive ports and removing unneeded 
              installation files."

              Not sure how I had missed this despite using macports
              for years.  From now on, I will have to remember to do
              the following when updating macports:

              $ sudo port selfupdate
              $ sudo port -u upgrade outdated
              $ sudo port reclaim

              See: https://lists.macports.org/pipermail/macports-users/2022-March/050900.html

              In other macports news, macports 2.7.2 is now available:
