09/18/2024    CMS confirms prior measurements of the W boson's mass:

              https://home.cern/news/press-release/physics/cms-experiment-cern-weighs-w-boson-mass

              1. The Standard Model predicts that the W boson's mass is
                 "80353 million electronvolts (MeV) within an uncertainty
                 of 6 MeV"

              2. In 2022, the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF)
                 measured the W boson's mass as "80433.5 MeV with an
                 uncertainty of 9.4 MeV, [which] differed significantly
                 from the Standard Model prediction and from [] other
                 experimental results"

              3. In 2023, CERN's ATLAS Collaboration measured the W
                 boson's mass as "80366.5 MeV with an uncertainty of
                 15.9 MeV, [which] lined up with all previous measurements
                 except the CDF measurement"

              4. CERN's CMS experiment has now measured the W boson's mass
                 as "80360.2 [MeV] with an uncertainty of 9.9 MeV, [with]
                 a precision comparable to that of the CDF measurement and
                 [] in line with all previous measurements"

              SM continues to hold.

09/18/2024    Proposed experiment to confirm QED photon scattering:

              https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s109

              "A long-standing prediction of quantum electrodynamics is
              that high-energy photons can scatter off each other.
              However, this process has yet to be observed because
              dedicated experiments have an extremely low signal-to-noise
              ratio. Now [researchers] ... have designed an experiment
              that could achieve a high-enough signal-to-noise ratio to
              measure the phenomenon[.

              ...

              [The researchers] propose colliding three laser beams: an
              x-ray beam and two high-power optical beams. The two optical
              beams provide the photons that scatter off each other, and
              the x-ray beam imparts a momentum kick to the scattered
              photons. This kick alters the trajectory of the photons and
              spatially separates them from much of the experimental
              background ... [increasing] the signal-to-noise ratio."

09/17/2024    Decreased smartphone usage might make people happier:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-09-smartphone-satisfaction.html

              "[T]he researchers assigned the [study's] participants, who
              all came from different professional sectors, to four groups
              of roughly equal size. The smartphone group reduced their
              private smartphone use by one hour a day for one week. The
              sport group increased their daily physical activity by 30
              minutes. The combination group did both, and the control
              group didn't change their routine at all.

              ...

              In the smartphone group and the combination group, the
              researchers found that work satisfaction and motivation,
              work-life balance and mental health had improved
              significantly. What's more, the feeling of work overload and
              symptoms of problematic smartphone use were significantly
              reduced. All interventions led to a reduction in depressive
              symptoms and they increased the participants' sense of
              control."

              "In 1953 Chandler sent a letter to a friend which included a
              jargon-filled passage parodying science fiction writing.
              ... The final sentence of Chandler's passage included the
              word 'Google':

              ...

              'I had exactly four seconds to hot up the disintegrator and
              Google had told me it wasn't enough. He was right.'"

09/17/2024    Vacuum decay may occur sooner than previously expected:

              "According to [prior] estimates, a cubic gigaparsec of space
              will see vacuum decay once every 10^794 years ...[;] [o]nly
              10^10 years have passed so far since the Big Bang. ...
              Recently, a group of physicists in Slovenia claim[] to have
              found a small error in the calculation, one that quickens
              the end of the universe as we know it to 10^790 years,
              instead of 10^794 [years]."

09/15/2024    Two Supermassive black holes heading for a merger:

              https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-022

              "The Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray
              Observatory looked in the heart of a pair of colliding
              galaxies and uncovered twin supermassive black holes
              waltzing around each other. ... They are approximately 300
              light-years apart - the closest AGN [Active Galactic
              Nucleus] pair seen in visible-light and X-ray wavelengths.

              ...

              The two supermassive black holes were once at the core of
              their respective host galaxies. A merger between the
              galaxies brought the black holes into close proximity. They
              will continue to spiral closer together until they
              eventually merge - in perhaps 100 million years - rattling
              the fabric of space and time as gravitational waves."

09/12/2024    Bose glass:

              https://phys.org/news/2024-09-discovery-phase-2d-defies-statistical.html

              "Physicists from the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge have
              created the first two-dimensional version of the Bose glass,
              a novel phase of matter that ... has some glassy properties
              and within it all particles are localized. This means that
              each particle in the system sticks to itself, not mixing
              with its neighbors.

              ...

              To create this new phase of matter, the group overlapped
              several laser beams to create a quasiperiodic pattern, a
              pattern that is long-range ordered like a conventional
              crystal, but not periodic, meaning that, like a Penrose
              tiling, it never repeats. When filling the resulting
              structure with ultracold atoms, cooled to nanokelvin
              temperatures ... close to absolute zero, the atoms formed
              the Bose glass."

09/01/2024    Picking up a Quicksilver G4:

              https://rubenerd.com/picking-up-a-powermac-g4-quicksilver/

              I had a 400MHz Graphite, a dual 1GHz Quicksilver and a dual
              2GHz G5.  Of these, the Quicksilver was my favorite because
              it was reasonably fast, easy to work on, and easy to carry.
              I've also thought about picking up one of these, but a 2005
              2.3GHz G5 probably would be more practical since it can run
              both OSX (10.4 and 10.5), OS9 (in Classic), and FreeBSD 13
              (with ZFS!).
