04/08/2022    Old style alerts on Big Sur (11.x) and Monterey (12.x):

              $ defaults write -g NSAlertMetricsGatheringEnabled -bool false

04/06/2022    Neutrinos may not be their own anti-particle:

              "CUORE has spent the last three years patiently waiting to
              see evidence of a distinctive nuclear decay process, only
              possible if neutrinos and antineutrinos are the same
              particle. CUORE’s new data shows that this decay doesn’t
              happen for trillions of trillions of years, if it happens at
              all."

04/06/2022    Modify font smoothing on Big Sur (11.x) and Monterey (12.x):

              $ defaults -currentHost write -g AppleFontSmoothing -int [0-3]

              where 0 disables smoothing, 1 enables light smoothing,
              2 enables moderate / medium smoothing, and 3 enables
              strong smoothing.

              This requires a restart to take effect.
