08/16/2024    Traceroute and modern firewalls:

              https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/TracerouteFirewallRealization

              "[The] default way that traceroute works is by sending UDP
              packets to a series of high UDP ports with increasing IP
              TTLs, and seeing where each reply comes from. If the TTL
              runs out on the way, traceroute gets one reply; if the
              packet reaches the host, traceroute gets another one
              (assuming that nothing is listening on the particular UDP
              port on the host, which usually it isn't).

              ...

              Most firewalls are set to block unsolicited incoming UDP
              traffic by default; you normally specifically configure them
              to pass only some UDP traffic through to limited ports (such
              as port 53 for DNS queries to your DNS servers).

              ...

              The best way around this is probably to use ICMP for
              traceroute ... Most Unix traceroute implementations support
              '-I' to do this."

08/10/2024    Pros and cons of setting a root password on Debian:

              https://www.reddit.com/r/debian/comments/1eoq6o3/should_i_set_a_root_password/

              I like the suggestion to set the root password after first
              boot:

              "What I do is skip the root password in the installer and
              then set one after first boot. ... The reason I use sudo
              exclusively but still set a root password is because grub's
              recovery console requires one."

              "But in the final balance, Stargate's writers may have made
              the right decision by keeping the Asgard as our benevolent
              allies - and not introducing an aggressively creepy
              antagonist."
