02/15/2023    Planetary System Types - Ordered, Anti-Ordered, Mixed, and
              Similar:

              https://www.sci.news/astronomy/planetary-system-architecture-11655.html

              1. Ordered: planetary systems where "the mass of the
                 planets tends to increase with distance from the star
                 - just as in the Solar System."

              2. Anti-Ordered: the "mass of the planets roughly decreases
                 with distance from the star"

              3. Mixed - "the planetary masses ... vary greatly from planet
                 to planet."

              4. Similar - "the masses of neighboring planets are similar
                 to each other"

              Ordered and Anti-Ordered systems result from "[l]arge, massive
              [planetary] disks with many heavy elements"

              Mixed systems result from "medium-sized disks" and "[d]ynamic
              interactions between planets"

              Similar systems result from "small, low-mass disks and stars
              with few heavy elements"

              https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2023/02/01/estimating-square-roots/

              1. For a given number n, pick a number g, where g^2
                 is a perfect square close to n

              2. Compute b = n / g

              3. Approximate sqrt(n) as (g + b) / 2
