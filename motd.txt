              I wonder why there is so much renewed interested in
              Cobalt kit?

03/10/2023    Things I've forgotten - make '.' the first entry in
              CDPATH so that cd searches for matches in the current
              directory before looking in other places:

03/08/2023    The RaQ2 is vintage computing now:

              https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/03/refurb-weekend-cobalt-raq-2.html

              I remember the RaQ2 was still new-ish when I started
              at Cobalt and the Qube3, XTR, etc. were still in being
              worked on.  Good times.

              Quantum Field Theory, as Simply as Possible by Zee
              sounds like a good read:

03/01/2023    Anitgone on "Kenneth Clark's Civilisation: A Personal View":

              https://antigonejournal.com/2023/02/kenneth-clark-civilisation/

              Mostly correct review of Civilisation, except perhaps
              for the statement, "[t]here is no more enlightening
              program in the history of broadcasting", because
              James Burke's Connections and The Day the Universe
              Changed are equally (if not more) enlightening.
