11/02/2023    Nice short summary of isolated, closed, and open systems:

11/02/2023    comm(1):

              https://man.openbsd.org/comm.1

              comm(1) showed up in Version 4 AT&T UNIX. I can't believe
              I didn't know about this until recently.

11/02/2023    N-9?

              https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/186
              https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-elusive-isotope-nitrogen-9

              "With seven protons and two neutrons, the lopsided atomic
              nucleus of nitrogen-9 pushes the limits of what can even
              be considered a nucleus at all.

              ...

              Protons and neutrons, the subatomic particles that make up
              atomic nuclei, are essentially glued together by the
              strong nuclear force ...[, b]ut the force can't
              hold together nuclei that have wildly skewed ratios of
              protons to neutrons. Too many of either particle -
              especially protons, which repel each other due to their
              positive charge - and the nuclear bucket starts to
              overflow.

              Beyond this overflow point, which physicists call the
              'drip line,' nuclei cannot fully bind their particles.

              ...

              Finding a nucleus as far beyond the drip line as
              nitrogen-9 - five protons beyond - was surprising ...
              [because, u]ntil now, scientists had only ever found
              isotopes up to four protons beyond the drip line."
