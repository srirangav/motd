11/28/2023    Applying Si to olive leaves promotes their growth:

              https://phys.org/news/2023-11-laboratory-silicon-olive-growth.html

              "The results showed that a foliar application of silicon
              of between 10 and 20 milligrams per liter favored growth,
              as the plants increased in size and grew more shoots, as
              well as exhibiting leaf stomata of greater density. As
              indicated by the research team, these beneficial effects
              may be associated with an increase in the absorption of
              nutrients, such as potassium, an element that the plant
              needs to grow."

11/28/2023    New model for superconductivity:

              https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/s170

              "The researchers found that the order parameter in each
              case is determined by the effective repulsion energy
              between two electrons located at the same atomic site in
              the crystal divided by the electron kinetic energy. This
              suggests that materials exhibiting stronger
              electron-electron repulsion should sustain larger
              superconducting currents and have higher Tc's. It also
              supports a particular mechanism for electron pairing that
              leads to superconductivity -a counterintuitive concept
              known as attraction by repulsion."

11/22/2023    Bacteria may be one of the causes of itching:

              https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/22/mystery-scratch-itch-staphylococcus-aureus-bacterium/

              "[R]esearch showed that when [the bacteria] S. aureus
              invades the skin, it releases 10 different enzymes, or
              proteases. One of them, called V8, latches on to a protein
              on nerve cells called proteinase-activated receptor 1, or
              PAR1. The scientists said they believe this starts a chain
              reaction from the skin neurons, to the spinal cord, and to
              the brain, which then triggers the urge to itch."

11/13/2023    The myth and reality of Snow Leopard (MacOSX 10.6.x):

              https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2023/11/5.html

              Some of the fond recollections for Snow Leopard are probably
              also due Lion (MacOSX 10.7.x) dropping Rosetta.

              Tiger (MacOSX 10.4.x) is also probably remembered fondly
              because it was the last version to include Classic.

              "On its first asteroid flyby on Nov. 1, NASA's Lucy
              mission discovered that the main belt asteroid Dinkinesh
              has a small moon orbiting it. Now, additional images have
              revealed another surprise: Dinkinesh's moon is not one,
              but two small satellites. The twin moons initially
              appeared as one because they are so close together, they
              touch as they orbit."

11/05/2023    Starfish are mostly head:

              https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/02/world/starfish-head-body-plan-scn/index.html

              "[N]ew genetic research suggests ... that sea stars are
              largely heads that lack torsos or tails and likely lost
              those features evolutionarily over time.  The researchers
              said the bizarre fossils of sea star ancestors, which
              appeared to have a kind of torso, make a lot more sense in
              evolutionary terms in light of the new findings.

              ...

               'When we compared the expression of genes in a starfish
               to other groups of animals, like vertebrates, it appeared
               that a crucial part of the body plan was missing,' [one
               of the researchers] said. 'The genes that are typically
               involved in the patterning of the trunk of the animal
               weren't expressed in the ectoderm. It seems the whole
               echinoderm body plan is roughly equivalent to the head in
               other groups of animals.'"

11/02/2023    N-9?

              https://physics.aps.org/articles/v16/186
              https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-elusive-isotope-nitrogen-9

              "With seven protons and two neutrons, the lopsided atomic
              nucleus of nitrogen-9 pushes the limits of what can even
              be considered a nucleus at all.

              ...

              Protons and neutrons, the subatomic particles that make up
              atomic nuclei, are essentially glued together by the
              strong nuclear force ...[, b]ut the force can't
              hold together nuclei that have wildly skewed ratios of
              protons to neutrons. Too many of either particle -
              especially protons, which repel each other due to their
              positive charge - and the nuclear bucket starts to
              overflow.

              Beyond this overflow point, which physicists call the
              'drip line,' nuclei cannot fully bind their particles.

              ...

              Finding a nucleus as far beyond the drip line as
              nitrogen-9 - five protons beyond - was surprising ...
              [because, u]ntil now, scientists had only ever found
              isotopes up to four protons beyond the drip line."
