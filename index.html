<a name="791a12d1975a29e6fd3a3261362f0a8a">02/16/2024</a>    Protons are complicated:

              <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/inside-the-proton-the-most-complicated-thing-imaginable-20221019/">https://www.quantamagazine.org/inside-the-proton-the-most-complicated-thing-imaginable-20221019/</a>

              &#34;Recently, a team led by Juan Rojo of the National
              Institute for Subatomic Physics in the Netherlands and VU
              University Amsterdam analyzed more than 5,000 proton
              snapshots taken over the last 50 years, using machine
              learning to infer the motions of quarks and gluons inside
              the proton in a way that sidesteps theoretical guesswork.

              The new scrutiny picked up a background blur in the images
              that had escaped past researchers. In relatively soft
              collisions just barely breaking the proton open, most of
              the momentum was locked up in the usual three quarks: two
              ups and a down. But a small amount of momentum appeared to
              come from a &#39;charm&#39; quark and charm antiquark - colossal
              elementary particles that each outweigh the entire proton
              by more than one-third.&#34;

              <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s17">https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s17</a>

              &#34;Generating neutrons using lasers typically involves two
              stages: first, a laser pulse ionizes hydrogen atoms in a
              thin foil and accelerates them to MeV energies; then,
              these hydrogen nuclei trigger neutron-generating nuclear
              reactions in a high-atomic-number material. ...
              [C]alculations indicate[] that a desirable isotope count
              could be achieved by slowing the neutrons to very low
              energies (to boost their capture cross sections) and by
              pulsing the laser at a sustained 100 Hz. While the
              necessary neutron energies can be achieved using
              present-day techniques, the laser pulse rates required for
              this scheme will only be possible using next-generation
              devices.&#34;

<a name="1c57becdb47e0332a3cc11f36b568d0a">02/13/2024</a>    The appendix may not be useless:

              <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/02/02/1228474984/appendix-function-appendicitis-gut-health">https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/02/02/1228474984/appendix-function-appendicitis-gut-health</a>

              &#34;It turns out that the appendix appears to have two
              related functions. The first function is supporting the
              immune system. The appendix has a high concentration of
              immune tissue, so it&#39;s acting to help the immune system
              fight any bad things in the gut.

              The second function that it serves is what we refer to as
              the safe house. ... During times of gastrointestinal
              distress - you know, a diarrhea episode where all of your
              good gut bacteria is getting kind of flushed out of the
              system - the appendix is kind of this blind tube with a
              very narrow diameter and narrow lumen, so the good
              bacteria doesn&#39;t get flushed out of the appendix. The idea
              is it&#39;s safe during this time of gastrointestinal distress
              and it can then exit the appendix and recolonize this good
              bacteria throughout the rest of the gut.&#34;

              I particularly agree with never omitting {} around a
              single statement condition, never putting { on the same
              line as code, never butting more than 130 characters on a
              line (though I normally still try to keep it below 75,
              except for URLs), and never putting local includes before
              global includes.
