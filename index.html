01/12/2023    Wormhole Coffee Table:

              The same master carpenter&#39;s Space Time Vase is also
              awesome:

01/11/2023    It&#39;s nearly 10 years old, but still correct, just use
              make:

01/09/2023    More granular brightness and volume settings on MacOSX:

              &#34;[T]o make more precise adjustments, hold down the
               Option and Shift keys together ... [and] [p]ress
               the volume or brightness controls.&#34;

01/09/2023    More on energy efficient pasta cooking:

              <a href="https://theconversation.com/italys-pasta-row-a-scientist-on-how-to-cook-spaghetti-properly-and-save-money-191973">https://theconversation.com/italys-pasta-row-a-scientist-on-how-to-cook-spaghetti-properly-and-save-money-191973</a>

              1. &#34;[T]urning off the hob midway and allowing the pasta
                 to cook in the residual heat will halve the cooking
                 cost&#34;

              2. &#34;[H]alving the water [used] resulted in perfect pasta&#34;

              3. &#34;[T]here is no need to bring the pan to a &#39;rolling boil&#39;
                 at 100 C ... [g]entle simmering is sufficient to cook
                 the pasta completely&#34;

              4. &#34;Keeping a lid on the pan is another simple thing you
                 can do.&#34;

01/06/2023    The secret of Roman concrete - self-healing because of
              the presence of lime clasts:

01/06/2023    December 2022 Books:

              Beethoven - The Universal Composer by Edmund Morris
              <a href="https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780060759759/beethoven/">https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780060759759/beethoven/</a>

              Wonderful compact biography of Beethoven.  It ought
              to come with a list of recommended recordings for
              each piece.

              Feynman by Jim Ottaviani (illustrated by Leland Myrick)
              <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781596438279/feynman">https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781596438279/feynman</a>

              Basically the graphic novel version of Surely You Are
              Joking Mr. Feynman and What Do You Care What Other
              People Think.  Excellent.
