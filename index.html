04/28/2023    Fluidic Telescopes bigger than JWST:

04/25/2023    Star Trek - Resurgence:

              <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-resurgence-launches-may-23rd-on-most-platforms-170248699.html">https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-resurgence-launches-may-23rd-on-most-platforms-170248699.html</a>

              Looks promising, perhaps a bit like DS9 - The Fallen (which
              I really liked), or TNG - Final Unity (which was also quite
              good).  Too bad no Mac release is mentioned.

04/24/2023    When there were ten Justices:

              <a href="https://stevevladeck.substack.com/p/3-the-tenth-justice">https://stevevladeck.substack.com/p/3-the-tenth-justice</a>
              <a href="https://stevevladeck.substack.com/p/19-when-there-are-nine">https://stevevladeck.substack.com/p/19-when-there-are-nine</a>

              &#34;[T]here were two brief periods in the Court&#39;s history in
              which there really were ten Justices: from May 20, 1863 to
              October 12, 1864; and from December 15, 1864 to May 30,
              1865. ...

              When Congress created a new Tenth Circuit in 1863 to
              encompass California, it likewise created a tenth seat
              (which President Lincoln promptly filled with Justice
              Stephen Field[) ...

              Field joined the Court on May 20, 1863. From then until
              Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney&#39;s death on October 12,
              1864, there were ten commissioned Justices (Taney, Wayne,
              Catron, Nelson, Grier, Clifford, Swayne, Miller, Davis,
              and Field), although it&#39;s not clear, given various
              illnesses and other absences, whether all ten participated
              together at any point during the Court&#39;s December 1863
              Term. And from the swearing in of Salmon Chase as Chief
              Justice on December 15, 1864, until the death of Justice
              John Catron on May 30, 1865 (so, most of the Court&#39;s
              December 1864 Term), the Court also appears to have had
              ten Justices at the same time.&#34;

              How did I not know about this?!?

04/20/2023    Return to oral exams?

              <a href="https://theconversation.com/why-universities-should-return-to-oral-exams-in-the-ai-and-chatgpt-era-203429">https://theconversation.com/why-universities-should-return-to-oral-exams-in-the-ai-and-chatgpt-era-203429</a>

              My contracts professor made us stand and answer
              questions in class.  I thought it was great.
              And most PhD programs still have an oral thesis
              defense.  Starting this early might make it less
              scary.

04/20/2023    Lockdown mode prevented zero-click exploits:

              <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/04/new-zero-click-exploits-against-ios.html">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/04/new-zero-click-exploits-against-ios.html</a>

              I have been using Lockdown mode since it first
              became availabe and the only feature that I&#39;ve
              seen that doesn&#39;t work when Lockdown mode is
              enabled is importing boarding passes from a
              text message / iMessage into to Apple Wallet.
              This is a minor inconvenience at most.

              Lockdown mode ought to be the default (and
              notifications should be defaulted off, especially
              on the lock screen).
