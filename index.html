02/28/2023    Dreams of a ZPM?

02/28/2023    The world&#39;s first carbon fiber reinforced concrete building:

              <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2023/02/21/henn-and-tu-dresden-complete-worlds-first-carbon-concrete-building/">https://www.dezeen.com/2023/02/21/henn-and-tu-dresden-complete-worlds-first-carbon-concrete-building/</a>

              &#34;German architecture firm Henn and the Technical
              University of Dresden have completed the world&#39;s first
              building made of carbon concrete &#39;&#39;“ a form of concrete
              reinforced with carbon fibre instead of steel.

              ...

              According to Henn head of sustainability Giovanni Betti,
              the slim line of the [building]&#39;s facade was made possible by
              the use of carbon fibre reinforcement, which is rust-proof
              and so doesn&#39;t need to be covered in as much concrete.

              &#39;Carbon fibre is four times lighter and six times stronger
              than steel and is not subject to corrosion,&#39; Betti told Dezeen.
              &#39;This means that the reinforcement does not have to be
              encapsulated in as much concrete to protect it from water and a
              same-sized section will be able to carry a higher load.&#39;

              &#39;Components and structures can be designed thinner, with
              material savings of 50 per cent or more. ...&#39;&#34;

02/15/2023    Planetary System Types - Ordered, Anti-Ordered, Mixed, and
              Similar:

              <a href="https://www.sci.news/astronomy/planetary-system-architecture-11655.html">https://www.sci.news/astronomy/planetary-system-architecture-11655.html</a>

              1. Ordered: planetary systems where &#34;the mass of the
                 planets tends to increase with distance from the star
                 - just as in the Solar System.&#34;

              2. Anti-Ordered: the &#34;mass of the planets roughly decreases
                 with distance from the star&#34;

              3. Mixed - &#34;the planetary masses ... vary greatly from planet
                 to planet.&#34;

              4. Similar - &#34;the masses of neighboring planets are similar
                 to each other&#34;

              Ordered and Anti-Ordered systems result from &#34;[l]arge, massive
              [planetary] disks with many heavy elements&#34;

              Mixed systems result from &#34;medium-sized disks&#34; and &#34;[d]ynamic
              interactions between planets&#34;

              Similar systems result from &#34;small, low-mass disks and stars
              with few heavy elements&#34;

              1. For a given number n, pick a number g, where g^2
                 is a perfect square close to n

              2. Compute b = n / g

              3. Approximate sqrt(n) as (g + b) / 2
