02/16/2023    Alpines might be coming to the US:

02/15/2023    Planetary System Types - Ordered, Anti-Ordered, Mixed, and
              Similar:

              <a href="https://www.sci.news/astronomy/planetary-system-architecture-11655.html">https://www.sci.news/astronomy/planetary-system-architecture-11655.html</a>

              1. Ordered: planetary systems where &#34;the mass of the
                 planets tends to increase with distance from the star
                 - just as in the Solar System.&#34;

              2. Anti-Ordered: the &#34;mass of the planets roughly decreases
                 with distance from the star&#34;

              3. Mixed - &#34;the planetary masses ... vary greatly from planet
                 to planet.&#34;

              4. Similar - &#34;the masses of neighboring planets are similar
                 to each other&#34;

              Ordered and Anti-Ordered systems result from &#34;[l]arge, massive
              [planetary] disks with many heavy elements&#34;

              Mixed systems result from &#34;medium-sized disks&#34; and &#34;[d]ynamic
              interactions between planets&#34;

              Similar systems result from &#34;small, low-mass disks and stars
              with few heavy elements&#34;

02/02/2023    Estimating Square Roots:

              1. For a given number n, pick a number g, where g^2
                 is a perfect square close to n

              2. Compute b = n / g

              3. Approximate sqrt(n) as (g + b) / 2
