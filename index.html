07/22/2022    XENONnT hasn't detected an excess of ricocheting electrons:

              "Two years ago, the XENON collaboration announced the
              observation of an excess of electronic recoil events in the
              XENON1T experiment. The result triggered a lot of interest
              and many publications since this could be interpreted as a
              signal of new physics beyond known phenomena. ... Today the
              XENON collaboration has released the first results from its
              new and more sensitive experiment, XENONnT, with one-fifth of
              the electronic recoil background of its predecessor, XENON1T.
              The absence of an excess in the new data indicates that the
              origin of the XENON1T signal was trace amounts of tritium in
              the liquid xenon, one of the hypotheses considered at the
              time. In consequence, this leads now to very strong limits on
              new physics scenarios originally invoked to explain an
              excess."

07/21/2022    Stargate audio dramas are being re-released:

              Never knew about them.  Something to look forward to.

              It's because of Chaosnet:

              So you have to dig 'ch.', Switzerland's FQDN:

07/12/2022    Desktop envirnoments resource usage comparied on FreeBSD:

              I'm surprised that XFCE uses more resources than MATE.
              Perhaps I will have to switch my VMs to test this out.

07/10/2022    BART uses broad gauge (like India) so that the lighter
              BART carriage are more stable in high winds and roomier:

              It is either "one of the most simple and most fundamental
              books" or a "revolting little book" that should "not be
              allowed to fall into the hands of decent young men and
              women".

07/09/2022    Debian 11.4 released:

              No problems upgrading from Debian 11.3 to 11.4 on
              Parallels on M1.

07/06/2022    LHC discovers three new exotic particles:

              "The first ... is a pentaquark made up of a charm quark and
               a charm antiquark and an up, a down and a strange quark.
               ... The second kind is ... an open-charm tetraquark composed
               of a charm quark, a strange antiquark, and an up quark and
               a down antiquark, and [] was spotted together with its
               neutral counterpart[.]"
