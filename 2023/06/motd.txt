06/15/2023    Where a program's config files should go on modern
              systems:

              https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/DotfilesWhereToday?showcomments#comments

              The modern preference is to store config files in
              "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/[pgm]", which usually ends up
              being ~/.config/[pgm].

06/12/2023    Excited He-4 nuclei do not appear to behave in the
              way that chiral effective theory predicts:

              https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-experiment-casts-doubt-on-the-leading-theory-of-the-nucleus-20230612/

              "To test the strong nuclear force, physicists turned to
              the helium-4 nucleus, which has two protons and two
              neutrons. When helium nuclei are excited, they grow like
              an inflating balloon until one of the protons pops off.
              Surprisingly, in a recent experiment, helium nuclei didnâ€™t
              swell according to plan: They ballooned more than expected
              before they burst. A measurement describing that
              expansion, called the form factor, is twice as large as
              theoretical predictions."

06/09/2023    Why elephants have whiskers on their trunks:

              https://phys.org/news/2023-06-elephants-whiskers-trunks.html

              "[T]he purpose of the whiskers [on an elephant's trunk]
              is to help the elephant gauge how much pressure to use
              when squeezing an object"
