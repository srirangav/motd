              &#34;Despite maintaining anonymity for over three decades now,
              Banksy could finally have his identity exposed in light of
              a lawsuit against the world-famous street artist and his
              art management and authentication company Pest Control
              Ltd.&#34;

              Sometimes the mystery is part of the fun - like with the
              Stig.

              &#34;In this cross-sectional study, machine learning was applied
              to 618,306 adult outpatient encounters to define the usual
              or mean &#34;normal&#34; temperature as 36.64 C [97.95 F].  Using
              individual and temporal characteristics, the range of mean
              temperatures for the coolest to the warmest individuals was
              36.24 C  [97.23 F] to 36.89 C [98.4 F].&#34;

              &#34;[W]e collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive
              prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed
              by Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery ... [which] asserts that
              when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same
              side it started -- D-H-M estimated the probability of a same-side
              outcome to be about 51%. Our data lend strong support to this
              precise prediction[.]&#34;

              &#34;Thermal dark matter models with particle X masses below
              the electroweak scale can provide an explanation for the
              observed relic dark matter density. This would imply the
              existence of a new feeble interaction between the dark and
              ordinary matter. We report on a new search for the sub-GeV
              X production through the interaction mediated by a new
              vector boson, called the dark photon A&#39;, in collisions of
              100 GeV electrons with the active target of the NA64
              experiment at the CERN SPS. ... No evidence for dark
              matter production has been found.&#34;

<a name="8e78b7db50a29122480385e33205dacb">10/14/2023</a>    Materials harder than diamond:

              <a href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/geology/is-anything-harder-than-a-diamond">https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/geology/is-anything-harder-than-a-diamond</a>

              &#34;A prime contender for a material harder than diamond is
              lonsdaleite. Like diamond, lonsdaleite is made up of
              carbon atoms, but they are arranged into a hexagonal
              crystal structure instead of a cubic one.

              ...

              Playing with diamond&#39;s nanoscale structure can also make a
              material that&#39;s harder than a regular diamond. A material
              that&#39;s made up of many tiny diamond crystals will be
              harder than a gem-quality diamond that&#39;s a single crystal,
              because the nanoscale grains lock up instead of moving
              past one another. &#34;Nanotwinned&#34; diamonds, in which the
              grains form mirror-image patterns of each other, are
              reportedly double the hardness of regular diamonds.&#34;

              &#34;Paleontologists studying fossilized Myotragus bones
              compared them to bones of reptiles living in the same
              region at the same time, and found surprising
              similarities. The bones of warm-blooded animals show
              uninterrupted fast growth, while the bones of cold-blooded
              animals have parallel growth lines showing interrupted
              growth corresponding to growth cycles[.] ...  Growth
              and metabolism rates are adjusted to suit the amount
              of food available, whereas warm-blooded animals require
              food to be available continuously. The Myotragus bones
              showed the same interrupted growth as reptiles.&#34;

Myotragus are the first mammals ever known to have achieved the same flexibility, and hence survivability, as reptiles.

<a name="a9f74ced7ef93a2424040580b08e86ce">10/11/2023</a>    The Elgin Marble&#39;s original colors discovered:

              www.livescience.com/archaeology/hidden-colors-and-intricate-patterns-discovered-on-the-2500-year-old-parthenon-marbles-from-ancient-greece

              &#34;To investigate the statues&#39; past, archaeologists used
              luminescent imaging, a technique that causes trace
              chemical elements from hidden paint on the sculptures&#39;
              surfaces to glow. The team quickly discovered hidden
              patterns emerging on the statues&#39; surfaces, revealing
              floral designs and smudged figurative depictions.

              Four pigments were primarily found: [1] a blue that was
              first created by the Egyptians and was the main color used
              by ancient Greeks and Romans, [2] a purple tint made
              according to an unknown recipe (most purple was made with
              shellfish from the ancient Mediterranean, but this one
              wasn&#39;t), [3] two whites likely derived from the mineral
              gypsum and [4] bone white, a pigment made from bone ash.&#34;

<a name="03dbf45d350279dfd4a866f08d22faef">10/06/2023</a>    Solar panels would work at Proxima Centauri, but not as well:

              <a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-10-solar-panels-proxima-centauri.html">https://phys.org/news/2023-10-solar-panels-proxima-centauri.html</a>

              &#34;The team found that while a wider band gap works well for
              sunlight, the light of Proxima Centauri would require a
              narrow band gap. For example, a simulated wide band gap
              solar cell has a theoretical efficiency of 18.9% for
              sunlight, but only 0.9% for Proxima Centauri. In contrast,
              a narrow band gap model has a theoretical efficiency of
              12.6% for Proxima Centauri.

              So solar panels could generate electricity from red dwarf
              stars [e.g. Proxima Centauri]. But one major disadvantage
              remains. Since red dwarfs produce much less light than the
              sun, even with a good efficiency individual solar cells
              wouldn&#39;t produce nearly the amount of energy we can gather
              from the sun.

              Interstellar solar panels would need to be significantly
              larger, which would greatly increase their weight and
              cost.&#34;
