              "Spiciness - or pepper heat - is measured using the Scoville scale
              and recorded in units called Scoville heat units (SHU). The units
              are based on levels of a chemical compound called capsaicin, the
              main ingredient that makes chili peppers hot. Pure capsaicin has a
              measurement of 16 million SHU while bell peppers, which contain no
              spice, measure at 0 SHU. Pepper X measures in at an average of
              2.69 million units[.] ... In comparison, standard pepper spray
              averages 1 million SHU, while bear spray is advertised around 3
              million SHU. The [prior record holder, the] Carolina Reaper
              measures about 1.64 million SHU."

              "In this cross-sectional study, machine learning was applied
              to 618,306 adult outpatient encounters to define the usual
              or mean "normal" temperature as 36.64 C [97.95 F].  Using
              individual and temporal characteristics, the range of mean

10/16/2023    Coin flips are slightly biased:

              "[W]e collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive
              prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed
              by Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery ... [which] asserts that
              when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same
              side it started -- D-H-M estimated the probability of a same-side
              outcome to be about 51%. Our data lend strong support to this
              precise prediction[.]"

              "Thermal dark matter models with particle X masses below
              the electroweak scale can provide an explanation for the
              observed relic dark matter density. This would imply the
              existence of a new feeble interaction between the dark and
              ordinary matter. We report on a new search for the sub-GeV
              X production through the interaction mediated by a new
              vector boson, called the dark photon A', in collisions of
              100 GeV electrons with the active target of the NA64
              experiment at the CERN SPS. ... No evidence for dark
              matter production has been found."

10/14/2023    Materials harder than diamond:

              https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/geology/is-anything-harder-than-a-diamond

              "A prime contender for a material harder than diamond is
              lonsdaleite. Like diamond, lonsdaleite is made up of
              carbon atoms, but they are arranged into a hexagonal
              crystal structure instead of a cubic one.

              ...

              Playing with diamond's nanoscale structure can also make a
              material that's harder than a regular diamond. A material
              that's made up of many tiny diamond crystals will be
              harder than a gem-quality diamond that's a single crystal,
              because the nanoscale grains lock up instead of moving
              past one another. "Nanotwinned" diamonds, in which the
              grains form mirror-image patterns of each other, are
              reportedly double the hardness of regular diamonds."

10/14/2023    Cold blooded goat:

              https://phys.org/news/2009-11-extinct-goat-cold-blooded.html

              "Paleontologists studying fossilized Myotragus bones
              compared them to bones of reptiles living in the same
              region at the same time, and found surprising
              similarities. The bones of warm-blooded animals show
              uninterrupted fast growth, while the bones of cold-blooded
              animals have parallel growth lines showing interrupted
              growth corresponding to growth cycles[.] ...  Growth
              and metabolism rates are adjusted to suit the amount
              of food available, whereas warm-blooded animals require
              food to be available continuously. The Myotragus bones
              showed the same interrupted growth as reptiles."

Myotragus are the first mammals ever known to have achieved the same flexibility, and hence survivability, as reptiles.

10/11/2023    The Elgin Marble's original colors discovered:

              www.livescience.com/archaeology/hidden-colors-and-intricate-patterns-discovered-on-the-2500-year-old-parthenon-marbles-from-ancient-greece

              "To investigate the statues' past, archaeologists used
              luminescent imaging, a technique that causes trace
              chemical elements from hidden paint on the sculptures'
              surfaces to glow. The team quickly discovered hidden
              patterns emerging on the statues' surfaces, revealing
              floral designs and smudged figurative depictions.

              Four pigments were primarily found: [1] a blue that was
              first created by the Egyptians and was the main color used
              by ancient Greeks and Romans, [2] a purple tint made
              according to an unknown recipe (most purple was made with
              shellfish from the ancient Mediterranean, but this one
              wasn't), [3] two whites likely derived from the mineral
              gypsum and [4] bone white, a pigment made from bone ash."

10/06/2023    Requiem for DEC:

10/06/2023    Solar panels would work at Proxima Centauri, but not as well:

              https://phys.org/news/2023-10-solar-panels-proxima-centauri.html

              "The team found that while a wider band gap works well for
              sunlight, the light of Proxima Centauri would require a
              narrow band gap. For example, a simulated wide band gap
              solar cell has a theoretical efficiency of 18.9% for
              sunlight, but only 0.9% for Proxima Centauri. In contrast,
              a narrow band gap model has a theoretical efficiency of
              12.6% for Proxima Centauri.

              So solar panels could generate electricity from red dwarf
              stars [e.g. Proxima Centauri]. But one major disadvantage
              remains. Since red dwarfs produce much less light than the
              sun, even with a good efficiency individual solar cells
              wouldn't produce nearly the amount of energy we can gather
              from the sun.

              Interstellar solar panels would need to be significantly
              larger, which would greatly increase their weight and
              cost."

              "In Fig. 2, we plot all the composite objects in the
              Universe: protons, atoms, life forms, asteroids, moons,
              planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, giant voids,
              and the Universe itself. Humans are represented by a mass
              of 70 kg and a radius of 50 cm (we assume sphericity),
              while whales are represented by a mass of 105 kg and a

              I like the two "Use BSD" wallpapers, the "Run BSD" (in the style
              of Run DMC), the two Unix 50 wallpapers, and most of the old
              school computer wallpapers (especially the HP 9000, which I
              used).  I'd like to find some wallpapers like this with Sun's
              (SS2, SS10, Ultra 1, etc.) and SGI's (Indigo 2 and O2).
