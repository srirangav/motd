08/28/2023    Apparently there may be problems with SanDisk external SSDs:

              https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/08/28/self-wiping-sandisk-extreme-ssds/

              I have several of these and they seem reliable, but
              since I mainly use them for backups, it might be
              prudent to add some Samsung SSDs to the mix.

08/18/2023    Measuring the true darkness of the universe:

              https://phys.org/news/2023-08-horizons-true-darkness-universe.html

              "Recently the New Horizons team tried to capture the
              fragile darkness of the universe. They aimed New Horizons
              at a patch of sky far away from the Milky Way, away from
              the sun, and away from bright stars. Then they measure[d]
              how much light the camera captured.

              When they compared that amount to the amount captured by
              Hubble's view of dark sky, they found it was darker by an
              expected amount, but there is still some faint glow [the]
              astronomers c[ould]n't explain. If you calculate the
              background light you'd expect from distant galaxies all
              the way back to the big bang, New Horizons measured about
              twice as much. So the team plan to observe 15 other dark
              locations over the next month, hoping to see the naked
              dark of the cosmos, or to verify this mysterious background
              glow."

              I'm looking forward to EagleFiler 2.x, which should
              be a native Mx (arm) application.

              Having used Postgres (and many other DBs), I'd
              say Postgres was always cool.

08/07/2023    Absent corrosion, Li occurs as a rhombic dodecahedron:

              https://phys.org/news/2023-08-true-lithium-revealed.html

              "Metallic lithium reacts so easily with chemicals that,
              under normal conditions, corrosion forms almost
              immediately while the metal is being laid down on a
              surface such as an electrode. But [] UCLA investigators
              developed a technique that prevents that corrosion and
              showed that, in its absence, lithium atoms assemble into a
              surprising shape - the rhombic dodecahedron, a 12-sided
              figure similar to the dice used in role-playing games"
