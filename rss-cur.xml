<title>A nucleus&#39; effective charge depends on the number of neutrons</title>

<pre>A nucleus&#39; effective charge depends on the number of neutrons:

<a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s65">https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s65</a>

&#34;The nuclear shell model assigns each nucleon to a
single-particle state that is similar to an electron
orbital in an atom. Researchers have previously shown that
the effective charge is different for different nuclei,
but it hasn&#39;t been clear whether the variation was
attributable to differences in the orbital configuration
of the nuclei or to differences in isospin (or both).

...

[R]esearchers observed cadmium-130 nuclei produced when a
uranium beam ... collided with a beryllium target. They
combined shell model calculations and the new data along
with previous data to determine an effective proton charge
of +1.35 for this neutron-rich nucleus, compared with
+1.17 for cadmium-98, suggesting an unexpectedly strong
isospin dependence of the effective charge.&#34;

<title>Cu coated stainless steel may kill bacteria</title>

<pre>Cu coated stainless steel may kill bacteria:

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-05-stainless-steel-bacteria-antibiotics-chemicals.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-05-stainless-steel-bacteria-antibiotics-chemicals.html</a>

&#34;An electrochemical process developed at Georgia Tech
could offer new protection against bacterial infections
without contributing to growing antibiotic resistance.

The approach capitalizes on the natural antibacterial
properties of copper and creates incredibly small
needle-like structures on the surface of stainless steel
to kill harmful bacteria like E. coli and Staphylococcus.
It&#39;s convenient and inexpensive, and it could reduce the
need for chemicals and antibiotics[.]&#34;

<title>The pyramids were built along long-lost branch of the Nile</title>

<pre>The pyramids were built along long-lost branch of the Nile:

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-05-pyramids-built-lost-river-scientists.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-05-pyramids-built-lost-river-scientists.html</a>

&#34;Scientists have discovered a long-buried branch of the
Nile river that once flowed alongside more than 30
pyramids in Egypt[.] ... The 64-kilometer-long river
branch, which ran by the iconic Giza pyramid complex among
other wonders, was hidden under desert and farmland for
millennia, according to a study[.]&#34;

&#34;Tauonium, composed of a tauon and its antiparticle, has a
Bohr radius of only 30.4 femtometers - approximately
1/1741 of the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom&#34;
