<pre>Average human body temp may be slightly lower than 98.6 F:

<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2809098">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2809098</a>

&#34;In this cross-sectional study, machine learning was applied
to 618,306 adult outpatient encounters to define the usual
or mean &#34;normal&#34; temperature as 36.64 C [97.95 F].  Using
individual and temporal characteristics, the range of mean
temperatures for the coolest to the warmest individuals was
36.24 C  [97.23 F] to 36.89 C [98.4 F].&#34;

<pre>Coin flips are slightly biased:

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04153">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04153</a>

&#34;[W]e collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive
prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed
by Diaconis, Holmes, and Montgomery ... [which] asserts that
when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same
side it started -- D-H-M estimated the probability of a same-side
outcome to be about 51%. Our data lend strong support to this
precise prediction[.]&#34;

<pre>Recent search for light dark matter at CERN turns up empty:

<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.161801">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.131.161801</a>

&#34;Thermal dark matter models with particle X masses below
the electroweak scale can provide an explanation for the
observed relic dark matter density. This would imply the
existence of a new feeble interaction between the dark and
ordinary matter. We report on a new search for the sub-GeV
X production through the interaction mediated by a new
vector boson, called the dark photon A&#39;, in collisions of
100 GeV electrons with the active target of the NA64
experiment at the CERN SPS. ... No evidence for dark
matter production has been found.&#34;

<title>Materials harder than diamond</title>

<pre>Materials harder than diamond:

<a href="https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/geology/is-anything-harder-than-a-diamond">https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/geology/is-anything-harder-than-a-diamond</a>

&#34;A prime contender for a material harder than diamond is
lonsdaleite. Like diamond, lonsdaleite is made up of
carbon atoms, but they are arranged into a hexagonal
crystal structure instead of a cubic one.

...

Playing with diamond&#39;s nanoscale structure can also make a
material that&#39;s harder than a regular diamond. A material
that&#39;s made up of many tiny diamond crystals will be
harder than a gem-quality diamond that&#39;s a single crystal,
because the nanoscale grains lock up instead of moving
past one another. &#34;Nanotwinned&#34; diamonds, in which the
grains form mirror-image patterns of each other, are
reportedly double the hardness of regular diamonds.&#34;

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2009-11-extinct-goat-cold-blooded.html">https://phys.org/news/2009-11-extinct-goat-cold-blooded.html</a>

&#34;Paleontologists studying fossilized Myotragus bones
compared them to bones of reptiles living in the same
region at the same time, and found surprising
similarities. The bones of warm-blooded animals show
uninterrupted fast growth, while the bones of cold-blooded
animals have parallel growth lines showing interrupted
growth corresponding to growth cycles[.] ...  Growth
and metabolism rates are adjusted to suit the amount
of food available, whereas warm-blooded animals require
food to be available continuously. The Myotragus bones
showed the same interrupted growth as reptiles.&#34;

Myotragus are the first mammals ever known to have achieved the same flexibility, and hence survivability, as reptiles.

<title>The Elgin Marble&#39;s original colors discovered</title>

<pre>The Elgin Marble&#39;s original colors discovered:

www.livescience.com/archaeology/hidden-colors-and-intricate-patterns-discovered-on-the-2500-year-old-parthenon-marbles-from-ancient-greece

&#34;To investigate the statues&#39; past, archaeologists used
luminescent imaging, a technique that causes trace
chemical elements from hidden paint on the sculptures&#39;
surfaces to glow. The team quickly discovered hidden
patterns emerging on the statues&#39; surfaces, revealing
floral designs and smudged figurative depictions.

Four pigments were primarily found: [1] a blue that was
first created by the Egyptians and was the main color used
by ancient Greeks and Romans, [2] a purple tint made
according to an unknown recipe (most purple was made with
shellfish from the ancient Mediterranean, but this one
wasn&#39;t), [3] two whites likely derived from the mineral
gypsum and [4] bone white, a pigment made from bone ash.&#34;

<title>Solar panels would work at Proxima Centauri, but not as well</title>

<![CDATA[
<pre>Solar panels would work at Proxima Centauri, but not as well:

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-10-solar-panels-proxima-centauri.html">https://phys.org/news/2023-10-solar-panels-proxima-centauri.html</a>

&#34;The team found that while a wider band gap works well for
sunlight, the light of Proxima Centauri would require a
narrow band gap. For example, a simulated wide band gap
solar cell has a theoretical efficiency of 18.9% for
sunlight, but only 0.9% for Proxima Centauri. In contrast,
a narrow band gap model has a theoretical efficiency of
12.6% for Proxima Centauri.

So solar panels could generate electricity from red dwarf
stars [e.g. Proxima Centauri]. But one major disadvantage
remains. Since red dwarfs produce much less light than the
sun, even with a good efficiency individual solar cells
wouldn&#39;t produce nearly the amount of energy we can gather
from the sun.

Interstellar solar panels would need to be significantly
larger, which would greatly increase their weight and
cost.&#34;

&#34;In Fig. 2, we plot all the composite objects in the
Universe: protons, atoms, life forms, asteroids, moons,
planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters, giant voids,
and the Universe itself. Humans are represented by a mass
of 70 kg and a radius of 50 cm (we assume sphericity),
while whales are represented by a mass of 105 kg and a
radius of 7 m.&#34;

I like the two &#34;Use BSD&#34; wallpapers, the &#34;Run BSD&#34; (in the style
of Run DMC), the two Unix 50 wallpapers, and most of the old
school computer wallpapers (especially the HP 9000, which I
used).  I&#39;d like to find some wallpapers like this with Sun&#39;s
(SS2, SS10, Ultra 1, etc.) and SGI&#39;s (Indigo 2 and O2).
