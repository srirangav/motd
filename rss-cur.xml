<title>Proposed experiment to confirm QED photon scattering</title>

<pre>Proposed experiment to confirm QED photon scattering:

<a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s109">https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s109</a>

&#34;A long-standing prediction of quantum electrodynamics is
that high-energy photons can scatter off each other.
However, this process has yet to be observed because
dedicated experiments have an extremely low signal-to-noise
ratio. Now [researchers] ... have designed an experiment
that could achieve a high-enough signal-to-noise ratio to
measure the phenomenon[.

...

[The researchers] propose colliding three laser beams: an
x-ray beam and two high-power optical beams. The two optical
beams provide the photons that scatter off each other, and
the x-ray beam imparts a momentum kick to the scattered
photons. This kick alters the trajectory of the photons and
spatially separates them from much of the experimental
background ... [increasing] the signal-to-noise ratio.&#34;

<pre>Decreased smartphone usage might make people happier:

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-09-smartphone-satisfaction.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-09-smartphone-satisfaction.html</a>

&#34;[T]he researchers assigned the [study&#39;s] participants, who
all came from different professional sectors, to four groups
of roughly equal size. The smartphone group reduced their
private smartphone use by one hour a day for one week. The
sport group increased their daily physical activity by 30
minutes. The combination group did both, and the control
group didn&#39;t change their routine at all.

...

In the smartphone group and the combination group, the
researchers found that work satisfaction and motivation,
work-life balance and mental health had improved
significantly. What&#39;s more, the feeling of work overload and
symptoms of problematic smartphone use were significantly
reduced. All interventions led to a reduction in depressive
symptoms and they increased the participants&#39; sense of
control.&#34;

<pre>Raymond Chandler and Google:

<a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/09/16/hot-sf/">https://quoteinvestigator.com/2024/09/16/hot-sf/</a>

&#34;In 1953 Chandler sent a letter to a friend which included a
jargon-filled passage parodying science fiction writing.
... The final sentence of Chandler&#39;s passage included the
word &#39;Google&#39;:

...

&#39;I had exactly four seconds to hot up the disintegrator and
Google had told me it wasn&#39;t enough. He was right.&#39;&#34;

&#34;According to [prior] estimates, a cubic gigaparsec of space
will see vacuum decay once every 10^794 years ...[;] [o]nly
10^10 years have passed so far since the Big Bang. ...
Recently, a group of physicists in Slovenia claim[] to have
found a small error in the calculation, one that quickens
the end of the universe as we know it to 10^790 years,
instead of 10^794 [years].&#34;

Overall sounds like a worthwhile upgrade once 15.1 is out,
especially Chess.app :-), FSKit, rotating random MAC
addresses:

But, running non-notarized software looks like it will be an
annoying two step process instead of the existing
right-click/control-click method:

1. &#34;[T]ry to launch the app and dismiss the dialog box telling
   you that it can&#39;t be opened.&#34;

2. &#34;[O]pen Settings, go to the Privacy &amp; Security screen,
   scroll all the way to the bottom to get to the Security
   section, and click the Open Anyway button that appears
   for the last unsigned app you tried to run.&#34;

<title>Two Supermassive black holes heading for a merger</title>

<pre>Two Supermassive black holes heading for a merger:

<a href="https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-022">https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2024/news-2024-022</a>

&#34;The Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray
Observatory looked in the heart of a pair of colliding
galaxies and uncovered twin supermassive black holes
waltzing around each other. ... They are approximately 300
light-years apart - the closest AGN [Active Galactic
Nucleus] pair seen in visible-light and X-ray wavelengths.

...

The two supermassive black holes were once at the core of
their respective host galaxies. A merger between the
galaxies brought the black holes into close proximity. They
will continue to spiral closer together until they
eventually merge - in perhaps 100 million years - rattling
the fabric of space and time as gravitational waves.&#34;

<title>Bose glass</title>

<pre>Bose glass:

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-09-discovery-phase-2d-defies-statistical.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-09-discovery-phase-2d-defies-statistical.html</a>

&#34;Physicists from the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge have
created the first two-dimensional version of the Bose glass,
a novel phase of matter that ... has some glassy properties
and within it all particles are localized. This means that
each particle in the system sticks to itself, not mixing
with its neighbors.

...

To create this new phase of matter, the group overlapped
several laser beams to create a quasiperiodic pattern, a
pattern that is long-range ordered like a conventional
crystal, but not periodic, meaning that, like a Penrose
tiling, it never repeats. When filling the resulting
structure with ultracold atoms, cooled to nanokelvin
temperatures ... close to absolute zero, the atoms formed
the Bose glass.&#34;

<pre>Picking up a Quicksilver G4:

<a href="https://rubenerd.com/picking-up-a-powermac-g4-quicksilver/">https://rubenerd.com/picking-up-a-powermac-g4-quicksilver/</a>

I had a 400MHz Graphite, a dual 1GHz Quicksilver and a dual
2GHz G5.  Of these, the Quicksilver was my favorite because
it was reasonably fast, easy to work on, and easy to carry.
I&#39;ve also thought about picking up one of these, but a 2005
2.3GHz G5 probably would be more practical since it can run
both OSX (10.4 and 10.5), OS9 (in Classic), and FreeBSD 13
(with ZFS!).
