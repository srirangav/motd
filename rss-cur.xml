<title>The vis-viva equation</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<pre>The vis-viva equation:

&#34;The vis-viva equation says that for an object orbiting another
object in a Keplerian orbit[:]

v^2 = u((2/r) - (1/a))

Here v is the relative velocity of the two bodies, r is the
distance between their centers of mass, and a is the semi-major
axis of the orbit. The constant u is the standard gravitational
parameter. It equals the product of the gravitational constant G
and the combined mass M of the two bodies. In practice it is
often accurate enough to let M be the mass of the larger object[.]

...

For an object to escape the orbit of another, the ellipse of its
orbit has to become infinitely large, i.e. a -&gt; [infinity]. This
says that if v is escape velocity, v^2 = 2u/r. For a rocket on
the surface of a planet, r is the radius of the planet. But for
an object already in a high orbit, escape velocity is less
because r is larger.&#34;

&#34;This is the 2007 Subaru Legacy 2.5i Special Edition in White. It
just happens to be the pinnacle of the automobile. Sure, cars
have gotten faster. Cars have always been faster. Cars have
gotten smarter. There are cars with better MPG, and there are
cars that are undoubtably a better bang for your buck in today&#39;s
market. But there&#39;s no car that is as good as this.&#34;

<title>Why matter is solid</title>

<pre>Why matter is solid:

<a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/quantum-reason-solidity-matter/">https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/quantum-reason-solidity-matter/</a>

&#34;[W]hat happens when you bring two systems, or two objects, that
are each made of atoms into contact with one another? Sure,
there&#39;s still quantum uncertainty and there&#39;s still electrostatic
repulsion, but now there&#39;s a third critical factor at play: the
Pauli exclusion rule that applies to electrons. When you push
your thumb down onto the seat of your chair, the electrons in
your thumb are already occupying all the lowest-energy states
that are available to them. Similarly, the electrons in the chair
are already occupying all the lowest-energy states available to
them.

This means that the act of &#39;pushing&#39; your thumb into the chair is
equivalent to trying to push those occupied electrons into the
same quantum state as one another: to have their energy levels
overlap. But those levels are full; you can&#39;t fit anymore
electrons in there! The chair&#39;s electrons would have to be bumped
up to greater energies in order to move into (or through) your
thumb, and your thumb&#39;s electrons would have to be bumped up to
greater energies in order to move into (or through) your chair.
No matter how strong you are, you simply don&#39;t have enough
strength in your body to overcome the Pauli Exclusion Principle
in this fashion.&#34;

<pre>The CAFC provides additional guidance on inherency:

&#34;The question we must resolve ... is whether a claim limitation
that merely recites an inherent property of an otherwise obvious
combination requires additional analysis to demonstrate that a
person of ordinary skill in the art would have a reasonable
expectation of success. We conclude that this additional showing
is not required.&#34;

&#34;Jineon Baek, a postdoctoral researcher in mathematics at Yonsei
University in South Korea, has arrived at an answer [to the &#39;sofa
problem&#39;].  ... Baek found that for a hallway with a width of 1
unit, the imaginary sofa&#39;s maximum area can be 2.2195 units -
narrowing the answer down with precision from the previously
known range of between 2.2195 and 2.37 units.&#34;

&#34;[A]nalysis suggests that drinking around three cups of coffee
a day is linked with an additional 1.84 years of lifespan in
the average person, with regular consumption also being
associated with increased healthspan (time spent living free
from serious disease).&#34;

&#34;The ALICE collaboration at the LHC has now seen the first
ever evidence of antihyperhelium-4, which is composed of
two antiprotons, an antineutron and an antilambda. The result
has a significance of 3.5 standard deviations and also
represents the first evidence of the heaviest antimatter
hypernucleus yet at the LHC.&#34;

<title>Gravitational waves and black holes</title>

<![CDATA[
<pre>Gravitational waves and black holes:

<a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/gravitational-wave-meet-black-hole/">https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/gravitational-wave-meet-black-hole/</a>

&#34;[Gravitational waves] propagate in the same fashion that
any massless quanta would travel, following the path laid
out by the curved space that they propagate through.

If that path takes you close to the event horizon of a black
hole, you&#39;ll experience all the &#39;normal&#39; relativistic
phenomena (redshift/blueshift, time dilation/length
contraction, frame-dragging, etc.), but you&#39;ll still be able
to escape so long as you don&#39;t cross the event horizon.

If you do cross it, however, there&#39;s only one option: you
fall inexorably toward the central singularity, and upon
crossing over the threshold of the event horizon, your
energy and your angular momentum - both of which
gravitational waves should possess with respect to the black
hole - get added to the black hole itself. In other words,
black holes do grow from devouring all they encounter, and
gravitational waves help that to occur.&#34;

species.  ... None has ever been seen alive at sea. The list
of what scientists don&#39;t know about spade-toothed whales is
longer than what they do know. They don&#39;t know where in the
ocean the whales live, why they&#39;ve never been spotted in the
wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have
different stomach systems and researchers don&#39;t know how the
spade-toothed kind processes its food.&#34;
