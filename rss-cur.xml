<title>Gravitational waves and black holes</title>

<pre>Gravitational waves and black holes:

<a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/gravitational-wave-meet-black-hole/">https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/gravitational-wave-meet-black-hole/</a>

&#34;[Gravitational waves] propagate in the same fashion that
any massless quanta would travel, following the path laid
out by the curved space that they propagate through.

If that path takes you close to the event horizon of a black
hole, you&#39;ll experience all the &#39;normal&#39; relativistic
phenomena (redshift/blueshift, time dilation/length
contraction, frame-dragging, etc.), but you&#39;ll still be able
to escape so long as you don&#39;t cross the event horizon.

If you do cross it, however, there&#39;s only one option: you
fall inexorably toward the central singularity, and upon
crossing over the threshold of the event horizon, your
energy and your angular momentum - both of which
gravitational waves should possess with respect to the black
hole - get added to the black hole itself. In other words,
black holes do grow from devouring all they encounter, and
gravitational waves help that to occur.&#34;

<title>Spade-toothed whales</title>

<pre>Spade-toothed whales:

<a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/this-whale-species-is-so-rare-its-never-been-seen-alive-a-dissection-may-decode-its-mysteries/">https://www.courthousenews.com/this-whale-species-is-so-rare-its-never-been-seen-alive-a-dissection-may-decode-its-mysteries/</a>

&#34;It is the world&#39;s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind
ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic
species.  ... None has ever been seen alive at sea. The list
of what scientists don&#39;t know about spade-toothed whales is
longer than what they do know. They don&#39;t know where in the
ocean the whales live, why they&#39;ve never been spotted in the
wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have
different stomach systems and researchers don&#39;t know how the
spade-toothed kind processes its food.&#34;
