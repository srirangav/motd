<title>Tungsten semi-carbine (W2C)</title>

<pre>Tungsten semi-carbine (W2C):

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-04-dimensional-nanomaterial-expansion.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-04-dimensional-nanomaterial-expansion.html</a>

&#34;Working at Interface Science Western ... [researchers]
formulated two-dimensional nanosheets of tungsten
semi-carbide (or W2C, a chemical compound containing equal
parts of tungsten and carbon atoms), which, when stretched
in one direction, expand perpendicular to the applied
force. This structural design is known as auxetics.

The trick is that the structure of the nanosheet itself
isn&#39;t flat. The atoms in the sheet are made of repeating
units consisting of two tungsten atoms for every carbon
atom, which are arranged metaphorically like the dimpled
surface of an egg carton. As tension is applied across the
elastic nanosheet in one direction, it expands out in the
other dimension as the dimples flatten.

Prior to this innovation, there was only one reported
material that could expand by 10% per unit length in this
counter-intuitive way. The Western-engineered tungsten
semi-carbide nanosheet can expand to 40%, a new world
record.&#34;

<title>New sunflower family tree</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<pre>New sunflower family tree:

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-04-sunflower-family-tree-reveals-multiple.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-04-sunflower-family-tree-reveals-multiple.html</a>

&#34;The sunflower family tree has revealed that flower
symmetry evolved multiple times independently, a process
called convergent evolution, among the members of this
large plant family, according to a new analysis.

...

The sunflower head, for example, is actually a composite
composed of multiple much smaller flowers. While the head
is generally radially symmetric - it can be divided into
two equal halves in multiple directions like a starfish or
a pie - the individual flowers can have different forms of
symmetry. According to the new study, bilateral symmetry
- where there is only one line that divides the flower
into two equal halves - has evolved and been lost multiple
times independently in sunflowers over evolutionary
history. The researchers found that this convergent
evolution is likely related to changes in the number of
copies and the expression patterns of the floral
regulatory gene, CYC2.&#34;

<title>Trying out OpenBSD ksh on MacOS</title>

<pre>Trying out OpenBSD ksh on MacOS:

A recent thread on OpenBSD-misc about switching default
shells from ksh to bash, finally gave me the motivation
to try and switch to OpenBSD&#39;s ksh on MacOS (I am a long
time bash user):

<a href="https://marc.info/?t=171198874500008&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">https://marc.info/?t=171198874500008&amp;r=1&amp;w=2</a>

The most recent OpenBSD ksh (7.4) is available in MacPorts
as &#39;oksh&#39;:

$ sudo port install oksh

On MacOS, OpenBSD&#39;s ksh is much smaller than other shells:

$ ls -l /bin/*sh /opt/local/bin/bash /opt/local/bin/oksh | \
sort -n -k5,5 | awk &#39;{ printf(&#34;%-20s %8d\n&#34;, $NF, $5); }&#39;

/bin/sh*               134000
/opt/local/bin/oksh*   244568
/bin/dash*             307248
/opt/local/bin/bash*  1050385
/bin/csh*             1153408
/bin/tcsh*            1153408
/bin/bash*            1326752
/bin/zsh*             1377520
/bin/ksh*             2598896

Other than perhaps tab-completion of variable names in
emacs mode, I don&#39;t see many differences.

<title>Hexagons are the bestagons (at least for self-assembly)</title>

<pre>Hexagons are the bestagons (at least for self-assembly):

<a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s36">https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s36</a>

&#34;Florian Gartner and Erwin Frey from Ludwig Maximilian
University of Munich simulated self-assembly of
two-dimensional structures with three types of building
blocks: triangles, squares, and hexagons. ... [They] found
that certain shapes were better than others at assembling
into larger structures, as they tended to form
intermediate structures with more bonds around each block.
In particular, hexagonal blocks were the most efficient
building material, forming 1000-piece structures at a rate
that was 10,000 times faster than triangular blocks.

The results are not limited to geometrically simple
shapes. &#39;Our insights hold relevance beyond these
simplified models, extending to a wide range of biological
and nanotechnological self-assembly processes,&#39; Frey says.&#34;
