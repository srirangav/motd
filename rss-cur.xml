<title>Cu coated stainless steel may kill bacteria</title>

<pre>Cu coated stainless steel may kill bacteria:

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-05-stainless-steel-bacteria-antibiotics-chemicals.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-05-stainless-steel-bacteria-antibiotics-chemicals.html</a>

&#34;An electrochemical process developed at Georgia Tech
could offer new protection against bacterial infections
without contributing to growing antibiotic resistance.

The approach capitalizes on the natural antibacterial
properties of copper and creates incredibly small
needle-like structures on the surface of stainless steel
to kill harmful bacteria like E. coli and Staphylococcus.
It&#39;s convenient and inexpensive, and it could reduce the
need for chemicals and antibiotics[.]&#34;

&#34;Scientists have discovered a long-buried branch of the
Nile river that once flowed alongside more than 30
pyramids in Egypt[.] ... The 64-kilometer-long river
branch, which ran by the iconic Giza pyramid complex among
other wonders, was hidden under desert and farmland for
millennia, according to a study[.]&#34;

&#34;Tauonium, composed of a tauon and its antiparticle, has a
Bohr radius of only 30.4 femtometers - approximately
1/1741 of the Bohr radius of a hydrogen atom&#34;
