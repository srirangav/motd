<pre>Hexagons are the bestagons (at least for self-assembly):

<a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s36">https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s36</a>

&#34;Florian Gartner and Erwin Frey from Ludwig Maximilian
University of Munich simulated self-assembly of
two-dimensional structures with three types of building
blocks: triangles, squares, and hexagons. ... [They] found
that certain shapes were better than others at assembling
into larger structures, as they tended to form
intermediate structures with more bonds around each block.
In particular, hexagonal blocks were the most efficient
building material, forming 1000-piece structures at a rate
that was 10,000 times faster than triangular blocks.

The results are not limited to geometrically simple
shapes. &#39;Our insights hold relevance beyond these
simplified models, extending to a wide range of biological
and nanotechnological self-assembly processes,&#39; Frey says.&#34;
