<title>Ancient stars may have made extremely heavy elements</title>

<pre>Ancient stars may have made extremely heavy elements:

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-12-ancient-stars-extraordinarily-heavy-elements.html">https://phys.org/news/2023-12-ancient-stars-extraordinarily-heavy-elements.html</a>

&#34;The team took a fresh look at the amounts of heavy
elements in 42 well-studied stars in the Milky Way. ...
By taking a broader view of the amounts of each heavy
element found in these stars collectively, rather than
individually as is more common, they identified previously
unrecognized patterns.

...

Those patterns signaled that some elements listed near the
middle of the periodic table - such as silver and
rhodium - were likely the remnants of heavy element
fission. The team was able to determine that the r-process
can produce atoms with an atomic mass of at least 260
before they fission.&#34;

<title>Wasabi may improve long and short term memory</title>

<pre>Wasabi may improve long and short term memory:

<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wasabi-memory-boost-japanese-study-finds/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wasabi-memory-boost-japanese-study-finds/</a>

&#34;[In a] double-blind, randomized study involved 72 healthy
subjects, aged 60 to 80. Half of them took 100 milligrams
of wasabi extract at bedtime, with the rest receiving a
placebo.

After three months, the treated group registered
&#39;significant&#39; boosts in two aspects of cognition, working
(short-term) memory, and the longer-lasting episodic
memory, based on standardized assessments for language
skills, concentration and ability to carry out simple
tasks.

....

Subjects who received the wasabi treatment saw their
episodic memory scores jump an average of 18%, Nouchi
[the researcher] said, and scored on average 14% higher
than the placebo group overall.&#34;
