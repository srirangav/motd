<title>N-9?</title>

<pre>N-9?:

<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-elusive-isotope-nitrogen-9">https://www.sciencenews.org/article/physicists-elusive-isotope-nitrogen-9</a>

&#34;With seven protons and two neutrons, the lopsided atomic
nucleus of nitrogen-9 pushes the limits of what can even
be considered a nucleus at all.

...

Protons and neutrons, the subatomic particles that make up
atomic nuclei, are essentially glued together by the
strong nuclear force ...[, b]ut the force can&#39;t
hold together nuclei that have wildly skewed ratios of
protons to neutrons. Too many of either particle -
especially protons, which repel each other due to their
positive charge - and the nuclear bucket starts to
overflow.

Beyond this overflow point, which physicists call the
&#39;drip line,&#39; nuclei cannot fully bind their particles.

...

Finding a nucleus as far beyond the drip line as
nitrogen-9 - five protons beyond - was surprising ...
[because, u]ntil now, scientists had only ever found
isotopes up to four protons beyond the drip line.&#34;
