Message of the Day (MOTD)
-------------------------

This is a minimal message of the day / blog that I use
to keep track of interesting or useful information.

The URLs for the motd are as follows:

    Text: https://srirangav.github.io/motd/motd.txt
    HTML: https://srirangav.github.io/motd/index.html

    RSS (all entries):

          https://srirangav.github.io/motd/rss.xml

    RSS (current month's entries only):

          https://srirangav.github.io/motd/rss-cur.xml

    RSS (current year's entries only):

          https://srirangav.github.io/motd/rss-ytd.xml

I was inspired by the following:

Technical Details
-----------------

The current month's motd is stored in the file motd.txt.
Each entry starts with a date (DD/MM/YYYY) followed by
4 spaces.  The rest of the entry is free form text.

When a new month starts, I create a directory under the
current year corresponding to the prior month, move
the motd.txt to that directory, and then start a fresh
motd.  At the beginning of a new year, I do the same
thing, except I also create a new directory for the new
year.

I mostly edit the motd using vi(m) or BBEdit.

The html version is generated by a simple perl script,
motd2html.pl.  The rss feeds are generated by another
perl script, motd2feed.pl.  Both scripts are available
in this repository.
