<a name="8915a4047f1832d4e784d1375554510b">04/21/2024</a>    Arabica coffee plants are over 600,000 years old:

              <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-04-morning-coffee-hundreds-thousands-years.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-04-morning-coffee-hundreds-thousands-years.html</a>

              &#34;[R]esearchers ... [have] found that the [arabica] species
              emerged around 600,000 years ago through natural
              crossbreeding of two other coffee species.&#34;

              <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-04-forgotten-city-identification-dura-europos.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-04-forgotten-city-identification-dura-europos.html</a>

              &#34;The Dura-Europos site in modern-day Syria is famous for
              its exceptional state of preservation. ... [T]his
              ancient city has yielded many great discoveries, and
              serves as a window into the world of the ancient
              Hellenistic, Parthian, and Roman periods. ... [T]here is
              another city, only some miles down the Euphrates river,
              that presents a long-neglected opportunity for study[:] ...
              the city of Anqa [] a near mirror image of Dura-Europos,
              of the same size, [and] comparable composition ...[.]

              ...

              Anqa is located just across the Syrian border from
              Dura-Europos, in the present-day Al-Qaim district of the
              Anbar Governorate in Iraq. Its remains include an
              identifying tell mound, at the northern end of the site, a
              polygonal inner wall circuit, and a large outer defensive
              wall, or enceinte. Situated at a point where the Euphrates
              floodplain drastically narrows, the city would have
              controlled movement between the populous section of the
              valley upstream and the trade route downstream linking
              Syria, Northern Mesopotamia, and Babylonia, giving it
              great strategic and economic significance.&#34;

<a name="794967b1e2021fcf9f6bd640656826b2">04/17/2024</a>    Tungsten semi-carbine (W2C):

              <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-04-dimensional-nanomaterial-expansion.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-04-dimensional-nanomaterial-expansion.html</a>

              &#34;Working at Interface Science Western ... [researchers]
              formulated two-dimensional nanosheets of tungsten
              semi-carbide (or W2C, a chemical compound containing equal
              parts of tungsten and carbon atoms), which, when stretched
              in one direction, expand perpendicular to the applied
              force. This structural design is known as auxetics.

              The trick is that the structure of the nanosheet itself
              isn&#39;t flat. The atoms in the sheet are made of repeating
              units consisting of two tungsten atoms for every carbon
              atom, which are arranged metaphorically like the dimpled
              surface of an egg carton. As tension is applied across the
              elastic nanosheet in one direction, it expands out in the
              other dimension as the dimples flatten.

              Prior to this innovation, there was only one reported
              material that could expand by 10% per unit length in this
              counter-intuitive way. The Western-engineered tungsten
              semi-carbide nanosheet can expand to 40%, a new world
              record.&#34;

<a name="855541edf570945883cd559de524a993">04/04/2024</a>    New sunflower family tree:

              <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-04-sunflower-family-tree-reveals-multiple.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-04-sunflower-family-tree-reveals-multiple.html</a>

              &#34;The sunflower family tree has revealed that flower
              symmetry evolved multiple times independently, a process
              called convergent evolution, among the members of this
              large plant family, according to a new analysis.

              ...

              The sunflower head, for example, is actually a composite
              composed of multiple much smaller flowers. While the head
              is generally radially symmetric - it can be divided into
              two equal halves in multiple directions like a starfish or
              a pie - the individual flowers can have different forms of
              symmetry. According to the new study, bilateral symmetry
              - where there is only one line that divides the flower
              into two equal halves - has evolved and been lost multiple
              times independently in sunflowers over evolutionary
              history. The researchers found that this convergent
              evolution is likely related to changes in the number of
              copies and the expression patterns of the floral
              regulatory gene, CYC2.&#34;

<a name="c7943f98e53bc5fd53579a8169624e76">04/03/2024</a>    Trying out OpenBSD ksh on MacOS

              A recent thread on OpenBSD-misc about switching default
              shells from ksh to bash, finally gave me the motivation
              to try and switch to OpenBSD&#39;s ksh on MacOS (I am a long
              time bash user):

              <a href="https://marc.info/?t=171198874500008&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">https://marc.info/?t=171198874500008&amp;r=1&amp;w=2</a>

              The most recent OpenBSD ksh (7.4) is available in MacPorts
              as &#39;oksh&#39;:

              $ sudo port install oksh

              On MacOS, OpenBSD&#39;s ksh is much smaller than other shells:

              $ ls -l /bin/*sh /opt/local/bin/bash /opt/local/bin/oksh | \
              sort -n -k5,5 | awk &#39;{ printf(&#34;%-20s %8d\n&#34;, $NF, $5); }&#39;

              /bin/sh*               134000
              /opt/local/bin/oksh*   244568
              /bin/dash*             307248
              /opt/local/bin/bash*  1050385
              /bin/csh*             1153408
              /bin/tcsh*            1153408
              /bin/bash*            1326752
              /bin/zsh*             1377520
              /bin/ksh*             2598896

              Other than perhaps tab-completion of variable names in
              emacs mode, I don&#39;t see many differences.

<a name="03595ed4811dcaf4552d7bcc1cd366fb">04/03/2024</a>    Hexagons are the bestagons (at least for self-assembly):

              <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s36">https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s36</a>

              &#34;Florian Gartner and Erwin Frey from Ludwig Maximilian
              University of Munich simulated self-assembly of
              two-dimensional structures with three types of building
              blocks: triangles, squares, and hexagons. ... [They] found
              that certain shapes were better than others at assembling
              into larger structures, as they tended to form
              intermediate structures with more bonds around each block.
              In particular, hexagonal blocks were the most efficient
              building material, forming 1000-piece structures at a rate
              that was 10,000 times faster than triangular blocks.

              The results are not limited to geometrically simple
              shapes. &#39;Our insights hold relevance beyond these
              simplified models, extending to a wide range of biological
              and nanotechnological self-assembly processes,&#39; Frey says.&#34;
