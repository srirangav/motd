<a name="1c4f14f2467d158fedb635e5c50f100e">01/13/2024</a>    The 18% O2 solution:

              <a href="https://bigthink.com/13-8/oxygen-bottleneck/">https://bigthink.com/13-8/oxygen-bottleneck/</a>

              &#34;Drawing on experiments carried out across disciplines as
              varied as combustion engineering to biogeochemistry, we
              found that an atmosphere with anything less than 18%
              oxygen would not allow open-air combustion. Remarkably,
              for most of our planet&#39;s 4.5-billion-year history, Earth&#39;s
              oxygen levels have been way, way below 18%.  In fact, only
              over the past 500 million years or so has the atmosphere
              held enough oxygen for anything to freely burn in the open
              air.

              Why does any of this matter? Imagine a young and
              intelligent species on an alien world with an atmosphere
              that&#39;s just 1% oxygen. Those clever tool-using creatures
              would never get the chance to watch a tree burn after
              being hit by lightning and get the idea of using fire for
              their own purposes. They would never have the chance to
              learn how fire could be used to cook food, clear land, or,
              most importantly, melt metals. The poverty of oxygen in
              their air would likely box these creatures in forever,
              limiting their development.&#34;
