              "Many people assumed [Steve Jobs] didn't use a badge.  But
              he did. ...  While almost every [Apple] employee had it
              pinned or on a lanyard, Steve kept his in his wallet. When
              badging in, he took out his wallet and held it to the reader."

10/28/2024    Eject when finished in MacOS Sequoia:

              https://appleinsider.com/inside/macos-sequoia/tips/how-to-use-macoss-finder-eject-when-finished-feature

              "Starting from macOS Sequoia you can now tell the Finder to
              auto-eject the .dmg's volume once the copy completes.

              To do so, mount the .dmg of your choice, start copying files
              by dragging them from the .dmg's volume to the Finder. Then,
              while the copy is still going, Control-click on the mounted
              volume and select Eject from the popup menu.

              If the copy is still running, the Finder will throw up an
              alert telling you it can't eject the volume because it's in
              use. But now in macOS Sequoia, that alert features a new
              button: Eject when finished. ... If you immediately click
              Eject when finished, the Finder will automatically eject the
              .dmg's volume when the copy is done."

              "There are now 52 known Mersenne primes, but the number just

10/10/2024    Gurung v. MetaQuotes - forum selection clause in EULA enforced:

              https://tlblog.org/a-troubling-decision-in-the-edny/

              "The district court [] held ... that the phrase ['[a]ny legal
              action or proceeding arising under this Agreement'] conveyed
              an intent to cover non-contractual claims for three reasons.
              First, it explained that Second Circuit precedent favored an
              'expansive reading of the scope of forum selection clauses,
              in keeping with the policy favoring their use.' Second, it
              reasoned that Gurung's claims had 'grown out of' the
              contractual relationship and that the 'gist' of her
              non-contract claims involved a breach of the contract.
              Third, the court concluded that the Gurung's non-contract
              claims involved 'the same operative facts as a parallel
              claim for breach of contract.'

              The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that
              enforcing the clause would be unreasonable under the
              circumstances. Although the plaintiff claimed that she could
              not afford to litigate in Cyprus, the court held that this
              argument was foreclosed by Effron v. Sun Line Cruises, Inc.
              ..., a 1995 decision by the Second Circuit, that [] enforced
              a Greek forum selection clause against a woman who had
              brought a slip-and-fall case against a cruise line
              notwithstanding her claims that she could not afford to
              litigate in Greece."

              or other objects and the whiskers are longer on the side
              they prefer wrapping towards, designating [] 'trunkedness'
              ... [-] [w]hisker abrasion appears on the opposite side of
              the one wrapped towards, as it is more often in contact with
              the ground."
