<pre>Protons are complicated:

<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/inside-the-proton-the-most-complicated-thing-imaginable-20221019/">https://www.quantamagazine.org/inside-the-proton-the-most-complicated-thing-imaginable-20221019/</a>

&#34;Recently, a team led by Juan Rojo of the National
Institute for Subatomic Physics in the Netherlands and VU
University Amsterdam analyzed more than 5,000 proton
snapshots taken over the last 50 years, using machine
learning to infer the motions of quarks and gluons inside
the proton in a way that sidesteps theoretical guesswork.

The new scrutiny picked up a background blur in the images
that had escaped past researchers. In relatively soft
collisions just barely breaking the proton open, most of
the momentum was locked up in the usual three quarks: two
ups and a down. But a small amount of momentum appeared to
come from a &#39;charm&#39; quark and charm antiquark - colossal
elementary particles that each outweigh the entire proton
by more than one-third.&#34;

<pre>Using lasers to build heavy elements:

<a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s17">https://physics.aps.org/articles/v17/s17</a>

&#34;Generating neutrons using lasers typically involves two
stages: first, a laser pulse ionizes hydrogen atoms in a
thin foil and accelerates them to MeV energies; then,
these hydrogen nuclei trigger neutron-generating nuclear
reactions in a high-atomic-number material. ...
[C]alculations indicate[] that a desirable isotope count
could be achieved by slowing the neutrons to very low
energies (to boost their capture cross sections) and by
pulsing the laser at a sustained 100 Hz. While the
necessary neutron energies can be achieved using
present-day techniques, the laser pulse rates required for
this scheme will only be possible using next-generation
devices.&#34;

<title>The appendix may not be useless</title>

<pre>The appendix may not be useless:

<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/02/02/1228474984/appendix-function-appendicitis-gut-health">https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/02/02/1228474984/appendix-function-appendicitis-gut-health</a>

&#34;It turns out that the appendix appears to have two
related functions. The first function is supporting the
immune system. The appendix has a high concentration of
immune tissue, so it&#39;s acting to help the immune system
fight any bad things in the gut.

The second function that it serves is what we refer to as
the safe house. ... During times of gastrointestinal
distress - you know, a diarrhea episode where all of your
good gut bacteria is getting kind of flushed out of the
system - the appendix is kind of this blind tube with a
very narrow diameter and narrow lumen, so the good
bacteria doesn&#39;t get flushed out of the appendix. The idea
is it&#39;s safe during this time of gastrointestinal distress
and it can then exit the appendix and recolonize this good
bacteria throughout the rest of the gut.&#34;

<pre>Things to never do in C++:

<a href="https://www.logikalsolutions.com/wordpress/information-technology/never/">https://www.logikalsolutions.com/wordpress/information-technology/never/</a>

I particularly agree with never omitting {} around a
single statement condition, never putting { on the same
line as code, never butting more than 130 characters on a
line (though I normally still try to keep it below 75,
except for URLs), and never putting local includes before
global includes.

<title>California&#39;s duck curve is getting deeper</title>

<pre>California&#39;s duck curve is getting deeper:

<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=56880">https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=56880</a>

&#34;As more solar capacity has come online in California,
grid operators at the California Independent System
Operator (CAISO) have observed a drop in net load (or the
demand remaining after subtracting variable renewable
generation) in the middle of the day when solar generation
tends to be highest. When graphed for a typical day, the
pattern created by the midday dip in the net load curve,
followed by a steep rise in the evenings when solar
generation drops off, looks like the outline of a duck, so
this pattern is often called a duck curve. As solar
capacity in California continues to grow, the midday dip
in net load is getting lower, presenting challenges for
grid operators.&#34;

1. Choose a 2-digit number, say 23, your &#34;seed&#34;.

2. Form a new 2-digit number: the 10&#39;s digit plus 6 times
   the units digit.

   The example sequence is 23 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 02 -&gt; 12 -&gt; 13 -&gt;
                           19 -&gt; 55 -&gt; 35 -&gt; ...

3. The &#39;random digits&#39; are the units digits of the 2-digit

&#34;Where exactly in the budget had the [FDR] administration
hidden the money for the bomb?

Finding a bill that passed eight decades ago is harder
than you might think, but after a number of creative
searches, I pulled up a record of a Senate hearing
examining the bill. Attached was a report breaking down
the legislation.

I paged through, stopped and smiled when I saw it. There
it was, the innocuous phrase that hid an $800 million
secret: &#39;expediting production.&#39;&#34;

<a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-01-primordial-dark-galaxy-stars.html">https://phys.org/news/2024-01-primordial-dark-galaxy-stars.html</a>

&#34;J0613+52 is an odd [galaxy] when you compare it to the more
familiar types such as the star-filled spirals and
ellipticals. For one thing, it&#39;s a dwarf galaxy with an
irregular shape. Without any obvious stars, it&#39;s quite
dim. The most unusual thing about objects like this one is
that dark matter appears to dominate their compositions.
If J0613+52 is like others, it could have up to 95% dark
matter constraining the neutral gaseous hydrogen that we
can detect. ... In addition, J0613+52 lies too far from
any neighboring galaxies to interact with them
gravitationally. That means they can&#39;t trigger star
formation through any possible mergers or collisions.&#34;

<![CDATA[
<pre>The 18% O2 solution:

<a href="https://bigthink.com/13-8/oxygen-bottleneck/">https://bigthink.com/13-8/oxygen-bottleneck/</a>

&#34;Drawing on experiments carried out across disciplines as
varied as combustion engineering to biogeochemistry, we
found that an atmosphere with anything less than 18%
oxygen would not allow open-air combustion. Remarkably,
for most of our planet&#39;s 4.5-billion-year history, Earth&#39;s
oxygen levels have been way, way below 18%.  In fact, only
over the past 500 million years or so has the atmosphere
held enough oxygen for anything to freely burn in the open
air.

Why does any of this matter? Imagine a young and
intelligent species on an alien world with an atmosphere
that&#39;s just 1% oxygen. Those clever tool-using creatures
would never get the chance to watch a tree burn after
being hit by lightning and get the idea of using fire for
their own purposes. They would never have the chance to
learn how fire could be used to cook food, clear land, or,
most importantly, melt metals. The poverty of oxygen in
their air would likely box these creatures in forever,
limiting their development.&#34;
